# blog

This is an empty repository for now, but I have the intention to move my [fred.dev](https://fred.dev) WordPress blog to a static site generator using Markdown files for writing articles. For now I mostly use it to create issues with [articles ideas](https://github.com/fharper/blog/issues). Feel free to vote on the ones you would like me to prioritize, or even suggest topics you think I could write about.
