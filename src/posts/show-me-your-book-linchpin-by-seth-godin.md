Recently, I finished the book Linchpin from [Seth Godin](https://sethgodin.typepad.com/).  It’s a book about you, me, us, who need to be indispensable in a world where there are many jobs, employees who can be replaced by computers. We need to be a linchpin, give our gift and get the job we deserve.

It was a good book. It could have been half of the size, since I think that Godin repeat himself too often, but you need to read it. It’s about creativity, learning from failure, the art…Here is one sentence from the book that can give you a good idea of what you will get from this New York Times bestseller:

> Great jobs, world-class jobs, jobs people kill for – those jobs don’t get filled by people e-mailing in résumés.

I suggest this book to anyone who doesn’t want to be a cog, people that want to be successful and think outside of the box... people that want to be, a linchpin.
