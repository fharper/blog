If you reply to everyone on an email, please do it as if your mail client has implemented a four step process to the reply all feature:

1. Click reply all button/menu,
2. Click YES on the popup that say "Are you sure you want to reply all?",
3. Click YES on the popup that say "Are you sure everybody in this email needs to read your reply?",
4. And finally click yes on the last popup that say "Did you read twice what you wrote, and are sure that YES was the right button in the previous popups?".
