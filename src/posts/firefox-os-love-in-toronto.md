Yesterday, I was in Toronto to share some Firefox OS love with my Canadian friends. I was invited to speak at a joint meetup with [Mobile Startups Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Startup-TO/ "Mobile Startups Toronto website"), and [HTML Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/HTMLToronto/ "HTML5 Toronto website"). The demo god wasn't with me as mostly everything went wrong at the beginning, but fortunately, the rest of the presentation has been great, and I was surprised but the number, and the quality of the questions.

As usual, here are my slides:

It's always a pleasure to come in Toronto, and even more to talk about this amazing OS. Remember, if you build a Firefox OS application or plan to port an actual web application to this platform, [please let me know](mailto:fharper@mozilla.com "My Mozilla email").
