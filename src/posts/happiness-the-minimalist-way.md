I'll spare you the details for now, but last year wasn't easy for me. Since, I'm slowly assessing my life to understand how I can reach my actual life goal: being as happy as I can be. One realization is that it can't be achieved with the lifestyle I had in the last couple of years: I need to declutter my life!

Minimalism isn't a new idea for me: it was one of my [three words two years ago](http://fred.dev/my-3-words-for-2014/). Still, I never explored to its fullest potential this philosophy. Now, I see it as one way to get back to the essential in my life, me. I see the minimalist as a step toward freedom and happiness:

- Owning less material by keeping what's really important for me;
- Keeping a small, but close circle of important people that matter in my life;
- Getting rid of dependencies and constraints that prevent me from doing what I want;
- Reducing the factors of stress in my life, no matter what or who they are.

For me, it's not about living a monk-like life! Those steps will help me get rid of the excess in my life, and redefine what's important for me. I'm pretty sure it's a lifelong process, but every little step forward is a step thru the real me, the happy me. It's the beginning of my journey, an odyssey that many of you won't understand, and I'm fine with it: I'm doing it for me...

P.S.: this is the first article from a series where I'll share my journey about minimalism.
