![](images/111.jpg "11")Since I have joined the team at Microsoft Canada, there is a running gag about [Damir](https://twitter.com/#!/damirb) being my dad: you have to admit that the resemblance is troubling. A couple of months ago, I made a t-shirt for myself saying that Damir is not my father. On the last [TechDays](https://techdays.ca) tour, I thoughts that it could be fun to have a t-shirt for Damir too. The result was awesome as everybody that know both of us laugh a good time. As I was always looking for this picture to show both of us, I thought that a blog post would be good. Thanks to [Ryan](https://twitter.com/#!/RyanStorgaard)
