Let's be honest, looking for a job isn't something I enjoy, yet, here I am, searching for my next role. I dream of finding a company that understand developer relations and where I'll be able to grow for years. Shouldn't be too much to ask, or is it?

I'm primarily **looking for a Developer Advocate role**: this is where I am at my best. I'm open to an IC (Individual Contributor) or a manager job. I truly enjoy sharing my passion about technology and helping developers being successful.

I have a [strong experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper/): eight years as a Software Developer and ten as a Developer Advocate. I've also worked at amazing companies like Microsoft, Mozilla, npm, Fitbit and DigitalOcean. [Public speaking is my superpower](https://fred.dev/speaking/) and something I truly enjoy: I gave more than 160 talks in 22 countries. I also have [a knack](https://fred.dev/www/) for creating video content like podcasts or tutorials. Noteworthy, my previous coworkers said that I'm [living on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fharper)!

To bring the most value to a company, I want to evolve in an environment where trust is a thing: you hire me for a reason! To be at my best, I need some level of freedom and stay away from micromanagement. I'm a fan of the lean startup approach: let's plan, execute, gather data, evaluate and continue, stop or adjust our tactics. This is how I roll...

One would say that it's a blessing to be Canadian, especially right now, but it's my biggest issue. It means that you need to be able to [legally hire me in Canada](https://fred.dev/canada/). Don't worry, it's easier than you thought and I've been remote, working for US-based companies for the last ten years. Important to note that I don't want to relocate in the United States or anywhere else in Canada. I would love to relocate somewhere in Europe though.

If you are afraid of vocal people, don't [think about me](https://fred.dev/workingwithme/). If you don't value being bold, don't think about me. If you are not open to fighting the status quo when it makes sense, don't think about me. If you are a company that don't value human life enough to be part of the social changes happening right now, don't even think about me!

So, if you like cats (it's how I judge if you are a great person) and you think **I am a FUCK YES**, [drop me a line](mailto:hi@fred.dev).
