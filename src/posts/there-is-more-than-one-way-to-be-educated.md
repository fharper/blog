This video gave me ghost bumps.

I may not be a billionaire or a star, but guess what, I'm loving what I do for a living. I'm happy when I'm waking up in the morning, and people pay me well to do my art (yeah, maybe I read too much Seth Godin books). All this, with no university or college degree. I'm a hard believer in education, not as much about schools, and diplomas... There are more ways to be an educated man:

- Read books;
- Find a mentor;
- Think outside of the box;
- Share with friends;
- Volunteer;
- Have discussions with people who don't have the same opinion as you;
- Open your eyes to the world;
- And, the most important of all, do epic shit!

For me, there is no better way to learn. It's not about exams. It's not about thinking inside of the box. It's not about school. It's about living!
