Travelling for work give me great opportunities: I can discover new cities, and the next one, [as you may know](http://fred.dev/ill-speak-at-praguejs-in-prague-czech-republic/ "I’ll speak at PragueJS, in Prague, Czech Republic"), is Prague. Funny enough, even if Prague is a popular destination, it's the one I have fewer insight on what to do as a tourist. There is a lot of suggestions on the web, but nothing that excited me like in other cities. Don't get me wrong, I'm so happy to visit Prague, but I think I need to find new things to do.

So for now, from what I found on the web, my list will include:

- [The Prague Castle;](https://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle/prague-castle-tourist-information/visit-of-prague-castle.shtml "The Prague Castle website")
- [St. Nicholas' Church](http://www.stnicholas.cz/en/ "St. Nicholas' Church website") because I like to visit one church in every new city: their architecture are amazing;
- [The Lennon Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon_Wall "The Lennon Wall Wikipedia page") because I like the Beatles;
- [Old Town (Stare Mesto)](https://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Facts-about-the-Czech-Republic/Old-Town-%28Stare-Mesto%29 "Old Town (Stare Mesto) website") will be a nice place to walk, and discover the city, and his treasures;
- [Astronomical clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_astronomical_clock "Prague Astronomical Clock Wikipedia page") because it seems to be one of the main attraction of Prague with the castle.

On the food side of the experience, I got a lot of good suggestions:

- [Brewbar](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Brewbar/491780760907331 "Brewbar Facebook page") is a coffee stand at the Naplavka farmer's market. The owner is an amazing barista we hired for the Firefox OS booth at the Mobile World Congress. It was the best coffee I ever had, so I'll repeat the experience there;
- [Strahov Monastic Brewery](https://www.klasterni-pivovar.cz/ "Strahov Monastic Brewery website") for a good local beer;
- [Čestr Ambiente](http://cestr.ambi.cz/en/ "Čestr Ambiente website") for a good meal;
- [Lokál Dlouhá](http://lokal-dlouha.ambi.cz/en/ "Lokál Dlouhá website") seems to be a nice little restaurant for something fast, but fresh, and tasteful;
- [Café Imperial](https://www.cafeimperial.cz/en/ "Café Imperial website") for another great meal.

For the prepaid sim card, I think I'll go with [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.cz/en/ "Vodafone Czech Republic website") except if you told me not. I've been served well in many European countries: the network is usually good, and the price is cheap. They even have a stand at the airport, which I like as it will be easier for me.

As usual, I'll find a [Starbucks](https://www.starbuckscoffee.cz/ "Czech Republic Starbucks") to see if they have local coffee mugs, and I'll do one or more [geocaches](https://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=7feede35-46e4-45da-a4d7-4c4bef7b729c "My Geocaching profile"), but is there anything I'm missing? Anything in my list I should skip? Any attraction I need to see or activities I should do? I know I need to taste one of the Czech Republic speciality alcohol called [Slivovitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slivovitz "Slivovitz Wikipedia Article"), but is there any typical food I should try too? Help me make this trip even better than it will be!

_P.S.: Since you always discover new things once on site, and that some stuff I listed may not be as good as it seems, I'm planning to share my insight, in a blog post form, about the cities I've visited to help others have an even better experience._
