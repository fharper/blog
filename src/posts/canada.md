So you want to hire me as an employee, but you don't have a legal entity in Canada. Lucky for you, there are two easy solutions.

First, you can create a legal entity in Canada: it's fast, inexpensive and easy. This solution only make sense if you plan to hire more people here.

The easiest way to legally hire me without a local entity is to use a [Professional Employer Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_employer_organization) (PEO). They will be the middle person between your company and myself. On paper, I will work for them: in reality, I will talk to them only for tax purposes. You will pay them as a service provider including my compensation, cost of benefits, and a fee for their service. The benefit of using a POE is that you can also provide benefits like health insurances. There are plenty out there, like [Deel](https://www.deel.com) that I've used more than once.

In the end, no matter the solution you choose, it will change absolutely nothing for the day-to-day work. So, **there is no more reason for not hiring me where I live**!
