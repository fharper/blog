Today I was in Toronto for the second Toronto user group workshop on Windows 8 with [HTML5 Toronto](http://htmltoronto.ca/), [JavaScript Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/torontojs/), and [DevTO](https://www.devto.ca/) in collaboration with us, [Make Web Not War](https://web.archive.org/web/20130628080719/http://www.webnotwar.ca/). Since I did all the presentations on the first event they did 3-4 weeks ago, I was only doing the keynote to wake up the people on this Saturday morning. As usual, here are the slides I used for my presentation:

Based on the underpants gnome business model, we took a quick 15 minutes to talk about why it's more exciting to build a Windows 8 application than being a unicorn in Wonderland. The plan was simple:

1. Collect the tools;
2. Build the apps;
3. Profit!

I won't write more details about what I've said as the recording of my presentation will be available soon, so I'll do a blog post with the video as soon as it will be available. On this note, enjoy your Windows 8 coding, and let me know if I can help!
