Two weeks ago, I received a copy of the book [HTML & CSS, design and build websites](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1118008189/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=outofcomzon-20&link_code=as3&camp=212553&creative=381305&creativeASIN=1118008189). I didn't have the time to read it yet, but at the first look it seems to be the most beautiful book I saw on this topic: really nice design and graphics. Hey, why technical book needs to be visually boring?

Thanks to Jon Duckett, the author, for the free copy
