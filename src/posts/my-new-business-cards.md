I am a big fan of being myself in every part of my life. So many people try to be someone else, but I think it's a good subject for another blog post. A couple of weeks ago, I made a [blog post](https://fred.dev/cartes-daffaires-plus-authentiques/) on my French blog about changing my actual business cards. I wanted something more authentic, that really represent me and my manager understood this.

I was looking for creating some cards that are more colorful, that talk more about myself, what I do and about my passion. Here are the cards I end up with (click on them to enlarge):

What is good is that I used Moo to print them, so I can have as many backgrounds that I wanted. **What do you think about these cards? Do you have any ideas for the next one? Do you think it's a good idea to have something that represents a lot more myself?**
