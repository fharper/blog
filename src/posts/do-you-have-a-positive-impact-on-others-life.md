I like to share: it's why I'm doing public speaking, and blogging. I want to share my opinion, but more important, I want to share my way of thinking, and help other to understand what I understood. It may be good for you, or not, but at least I'm trying.

Yesterday evening I was at the Open Data Holiday dinner, and someone thanks me for the post I did during the day. This person had a shitty day, missed his flight, and getting some bad feedbacks about an event he did. My post was about the fact that you can't please everybody, and that it's OK if people disagree with you, or don't like what you did/said. It makes me happy as I always say that if my post or my presentations changed only one person's mind in a positive way; IÂ  did a good job!

In today's world, it's more important than ever to not just think about yourself, but also think about others, and not just your friends, and family. Seeing what is happening day to day in the world, maybe I'm foolish, but I think each of us can change this world to make it a better place to live, and sharing your good thoughts, your tricks, or everything that helps people to have a better life is something we all should do.

As Baden Powell was saying: leave this world a little better than you found it.
