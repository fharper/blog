A couple of months ago, [Franck Nlemba](https://www.francknlemba.com/) contacted me about a project he was working on: a conference in Montreal with the mission to help Africans to learn about all the possibilities they have when they come in Montreal, but also, to try to reinforce the relationship between this extremely passionate community, and the Montreal Web industry. He didn't take me too long to jump in the ship, and help him to make contact with the right folks.

The [Kongossa Web Series (KWS) Montreal site](https://www.kws-forum.org/?lang=en) is now live, and I'm happy to let you know that the event will be held at the Amphitheater Ernst & Young in Concordia University on September 21st. This "Montreal Style" (French & English) event will focus on social, and economic development of technology: a topic worth for everyone! You'll have local speakers as [Rami Sayar](https://ramisayar.com/), and myself, but you'll also have the chance to see international ones. No technical presentation for me as for my keynote, I'll share my experience about another topic that really passionate me: the personal branding. Here is the abstract of my talk "Personal branding, more important than ever":

You may think that personal branding is not for you? Why would you care about your own branding, you aren't an actor nor the singer of an international rock band, no? In those days where everyone has the power to stand out more easily, share more quickly, and grow their network like never before, it's more important than ever to think about yourself as a brand. Of course, it's not about going as far as your favorite soft drink brand, but we'll explore together the what, why, who, and how of personal branding.

On that note, I encourage you to [join us](https://kws-montreal.eventbrite.ca/) on the 21st of September, and [buy your ticket right now](https://kws-montreal.eventbrite.ca/). It's for everybody, not just Africans! It'll be a chance for all of us to see great presentations, learn from startups, meet international speakers, foster the entrepreneurship in Montreal, tighten our relationship with different culture, assist to amazing workshops, and of course, network with other passionate.
