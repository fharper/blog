I thought it would be useful to list the Chrome extensions I'm currently using as I share some of them every now, and then. So think of this as a [GitHub awesome lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome), but not community-curated! Here are the ones I'm using:

- [1Password](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-%E2%80%93-password-mana/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa): this is the [1Password](https://1password.com/) application helper.
- [Ad Blocker Notice Removal](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ad-blocker-notice-removal/bnohpbaeckhhfnfijdnapgmbldkigchl/): remove ad blocker notices ([source code](https://github.com/fire015/adblocker-notice-removal)).
- [AdBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-%E2%80%94-best-ad-blocker/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom): ad blocker.
- [Antidote Connector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/connecteur-antidote/lmbopdiikkamfphhgcckcjhojnokgfeo): this is the [Antidote](https://www.antidote.info/en/) application helped.

- [Default Account for Google products](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/default-account-for-googl/bnocikekcdchphdpfffcgikiblhnkdad/related?authuser=0): let you set a default Google Account per Google services.
- [Disable All Extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-all-extensions/ailfldpmpboolaihojfagmmfbhcgohne/): when I need to test a site real speed or I suspect the extensions to cause a site issues ([source code](https://github.com/ItzBlinkzy/disable-all-extensions)).
- [Eight Dollars](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eight-dollars/fjbponfbognnefnmbffcfllkibbbobki): show you who paid for Twitter vs actual verified people, which help me filter fake accounts ([source code](https://github.com/wseagar/eight-dollars)).
- [Empty New Tab Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/empty-new-tab-page/dpjamkmjmigaoobjbekmfgabipmfilij): do what it says. The minimalist in me doesn't like bloated new tabs all browsers have.
- [File Icons for GitHub and GitLab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/file-icons-for-github-and/ficfmibkjjnpogdcfhfokmihanoldbfe): add proper icons to files on GitHub, and GitLab. Seriously make using the web interface nicer ([source code](https://github.com/homerchen19/github-file-icons)).
- [Google Docs Offline](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-docs-offline/ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi): useful when using Google Docs or Slides in the plane.
- [GooglePanicImages](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/googlepanicimages/ofnokbendbpfgbomaepcomeciblhphip): the name is weird, but it adds a view button on all images so you can directly view the image only, instead of the page containing it ([source code](https://github.com/jrie/googlePanicImage)).
- [Hello, Goodbye](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hello-goodbye/nihpfpbibfgpgnfpbfedkdokihggapoi/): remove chat widgets (you can disable it for a specific site when needed). It's also easy to report a site not working ([source code](https://github.com/bcye/Hello-Goodbye)).
- [I still don't care about cookies](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/i-still-dont-care-about-c/edibdbjcniadpccecjdfdjjppcpchdlm): getting rid of cookies banners. It's a fork of "I don't care about cookies" extension which was acquired by Avast ([source code](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/I-Still-Dont-Care-About-Cookies)).
- [Image Downloader - Save pictures](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-downloader-save-pic/daeljdgmllhgmbdkpgnaojldjkdgkbjg): lazy me don't always want to find images URL in the web page source or in the developer network tab.
- [Improve YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/improve-youtube-%F0%9F%8E%A7-for-yo/bnomihfieiccainjcjblhegjgglakjdd): give you a lot more control over YouTube. I mainly use it to pause video on load.
- [Lovely forks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lovely-forks/ialbpcipalajnakfondkflpkagbkdoib): show most popular GitHub fork for a specific repository ([source code](https://github.com/musically-ut/lovely-forks)).

- [Pop up blocker for Chrome - Poper Blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pop-up-blocker-for-chrome/bkkbcggnhapdmkeljlodobbkopceiche): block popup pretty well.
- [Refined GitHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-github/hlepfoohegkhhmjieoechaddaejaokhf): add so many useful features to the GitHub interface ([source code](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github)).
- [Reload All Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reload-all-tabs/midkcinmplflbiflboepnahkboeonkam): useful as sometimes the browser load when my wifi is not yet connected ([source code](https://github.com/mohamedmansour/reload-all-tabs-extension/)).
- [Save to Pocket (mini)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket-mini/calnfcidhlhdmmmnicdpddbmmjmfohem): same as the official Pocket extension, but requiring less permissions ([source code](https://github.com/evmar/pocket-mini)).
- [Session Buddy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko): a must-have to automatically, and manually save sessions (tabs & windows)! Sometimes when the browser crash, it doesn't save the session. I also often need to close all tabs for livestreams or when recording my screen, but still need to reopen them after.
- [Share on Twitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/share-on-twitter/gkjgmeeoldebbdoehhngapnlfmdbmiie): sharing web pages easily on Twitter.
- [Simplified Twitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplified-twitter/kfopmjhmejbgomgeajemgpgpbckpoopg): making the Twitter experience so much better as it removes all the Twitter garbage, keeping only the feed ([source code](https://github.com/brunolemos/simplified-twitter)).
- [Sprucemarks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sprucemarks/fakeocdnmmmnokabaiflppclocckihoj): it does much more than that, but I use it mostly so my bookmarks are automatically sorted ASC.
- [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne): overwrite CSS on desired websites with custom styles ([source code](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/)).
- [Tab Muter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-muter/bnclejfcblondkjliiblkojdeloomadd): mute the sound from a specific tab. Brave does it when you click on the speaker icon on the tab, but Chrome needs an extension ([source code](https://github.com/sersorrel/mute-tab)).
- [TabsPlus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabsplus/nikomkkhhpfoeamojhhgpfkpkdlfhfii): does more than that, but I mostly use it to define where a new tab opens, and which tab get the focus when one is closed.
- [Torimodosu](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/torimodosu/bneejjfggkkiemoojmfjfepcoeaohbdc): change back the Twitter icon to Larry. I saw a lot of ugly redesigned and rebranding since the web exist, but this one is #1 in my list ([source code](https://github.com/hakuwo/Torimodosu)).
- [uBlacklist](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe): prevent some URLs from being displayed in Google search results: useful to hide sites you know are shit ([source code](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist)).
- [ViolentMonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag): userscripts support for browsers ([source code](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey)).

I try to keep the number on the low-ish side for performance, but feel free to suggest any extensions you think I should use.
