I meet [Josh Clark](https://globalmoxie.com/) at the first edition of [Go Beyond Pixels](https://gobeyondpixels.com/), and it was a real pleasure to meet him: he always has a smile on his face, and he is a very nice guy. When I saw he was speaking at the [Web à Québec](https://webaquebec.org/), I immediately asked him to do an interview for the [never born Make Web Not War TV project](https://fred.dev/make-web-not-war-tv-an-unfinished-project/ "Make Web Not War TV – An unfinished project"). We mainly talk about design, and great mobile experiences. The author of [Tapworthy](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1449381650/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=1449381650&linkCode=as2&tag=outofcomzon-20) also addressed sensors, touch devices, the Internet of things, the future, and we briefly argue about Star Trek vs Star Wars.

What is a great mobile experience for you? Should we always design for touch? What will be the future of the Web? Share your thoughts.
