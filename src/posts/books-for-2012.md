I always find it hard when people ask me “What do you want for Christmas?”. First, I’m difficult, so they learn that they should ask me. Secondly, I usually like things that cost too much: I know, I’m such a luxury whore. So, this year, as I’m now the owner of a Kindle Touch (I’ll make a review on the device, since I used Kobo until the beginning of my switch from books to e-books) and [I really want to read more](https://fred.dev/show-me-your-book/ "Show me your book") in 2012, I suggested to my girlfriend an Amazon’s gift card.

These are some of the books I bought with it and that I’ll read in 2012:
