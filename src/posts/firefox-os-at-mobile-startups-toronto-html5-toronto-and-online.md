![Matthew_Fred](images/Matthew_Fred.jpg)A little less than one month ago, I was [writing about a presentation on Firefox OS I'll do at Mobile Startups Toronto in January](http://fred.dev/mobile-startups-toronto-and-firefox-os-as-an-opportunity/ "Mobile Startups Toronto, and Firefox OS as an opportunity"). It went fast as the event is already in two days...

Since, [HTML5 Toronto](http://htmltoronto.ca/ "HTML5 Toronto website") as join to co-host the event with the nice folks at [Mobile Startups Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Startup-TO/ "Mobile Startups Toronto website"). They'll also [stream the event live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHWGeeIwBcY "YouTube link for streaming event") for people who can't assist in person. So if you are free, and in Toronto, come join us this Wednesday at 18:45 at the [Mozilla Community Space](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/toronto/ "Mozilla Toronto Community Space") (366 Adelaide St. W, Suite 500), and don't forget to register first, either at the [Mobile Startups Toronto meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Startups-TO/events/152828322/ "Mobile Startups Toronto registration page") or on the [HTML5 Toronto one](https://www.meetup.com/HTML5-Web-App-Developers/events/155519012/ "HTML5 Toronto registration page"). Whether I'm presenting or wants to watch a presentation, I always prefer to go in-person: the experience is never the same, and the networking part is a huge plus, so I highly encourage you to do the same. For those of you that aren't in Toronto, or even in Canada, but are still available at that time, you'll be able to watch the session by [joining the live event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHWGeeIwBcY "YouTube link for streaming event") on the [YouTube channel of HTML5 Toronto](https://www.youtube.com/user/HTML5Toronto). Keep in mind that the video will also be available on their channel soon after the event.

Yesterday, [Matthew Potter](https://twitter.com/AskMP "Matthew Potter's Twitter account"), the mastermind behind the HTML5 Toronto user group, did an #StreamingSunday live interview with me.

I hope to see you in Toronto Wednesday evening, but if you can't join, but would like to meet, let me know.
