Don't overreact, the title is just to get you to this post as I'm not really crowdsourcing my bio (nor thinking I'm important enough to have a full biography!). You know, [I'm in the process of changing job](http://fred.dev/im-joining-mozilla/ "I’m joining Mozilla"), and I need to review my bio (for conferences, articles... I'm doing). Since I suck at it, I thought it would be nice to get your ideas from what you know about me, what you read on [this blog](http://fred.dev), the laugh we share, what you saw on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fharper), the event we worked on together, what I share on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fharper), the good & bad moments we had, the [presentations I did](https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper), my experience on my [LinkedIn profile...](https://linkedin.com/in/fredericharper) So far, here what I have:

> In the IT world for more than 10 years, Frédéric Harper started as a developer working with different technologies focusing on Web, and mobile development. One day, Frédéric got a revelation, and decided to use his social skills to become an Evangelist. He spent a few years showing the Openness of Microsoft talking about Open Source, Web standards, and Interoperability. Now, as a Senior Technical Evangelist at Mozilla, Fred shares his passion about the Open Web, and help developers be successful with Firefox OS. Experienced speaker, t-shirts wearer, long-time blogger, passionate hugger, and HTML5 lover, Fred lives in Montréal, and speak Frenglish. Always conscious about the importance of unicorns, and gnomes, you can read about these topics, and other thoughts at fred.dev.

What is missing? What do I need to remove? What should I change? It need to be "Fred style" (thence the unicorns, gnomes, and Frenglish), but still good for different cultures... Share your thoughts... or not!
