On the last day of 2012, it has been 2 years that I'm a Microsoftie (internal name for a Microsoft employee). As things are related for now, it has also been two years that I'm being paid to do what I like to do for a living, Evangelism!

Time goes quickly as I feel like it was yesterday that I've become a blue badge (another way of talking about a full time employee at Microsoft). A lot of things have changed since [last year](https://fred.dev/one-year-at-the-evil-empire/):

- The Evangelism job has changed at Microsoft Canada, and I still need to adapt;
- A member of my v-team, [Julia](https://twitter.com/InteropQueen) got pregnant, and [Keith](https://keithloo.com/blog/) took her role;
- We changed a little bit the focus of my primary audience;
- I started the year with a new partner in crime, [Reemah](https://reemah.posterous.com/), as my first one, [Samantha](https://twitter.com/sammwong), got a new role. Half-way during the year, I changed again for [Vanessa](https://twitter.com/VanBees) (hey, all "a" names), as Reemah also got a new role (maybe I scared them - I'm curios to see how much time Vanessa will tough me);
- The 3 products I'm focussing on had new releases: Windows, Windows Phone, and Windows Azure;
- Two team members, my [unknown father](https://fred.dev/my-unknown-father/) [Damir](https://twitter.com/DamirB), and [Rick](https://twitter.com/RicksterCDN), changed roles inside of Microsoft (yes there is always a lot of movement between roles at Microsoft), and another one, [Ruth](https://ruthlindamorton.com/), left the company;
- Two new members, [Marc](https://www.gotsomething.com/), and [Pierre](https://roman.azurewebsites.net/), join the family (my direct team);
- ...

I also learn a lot of new stuff during this crazy year:

- There are people who I don't want to waste time anymore with (I have no problem with the fact you don't like us or our products, but I have one with the fact you can't have a discussion);
- It's a good time to be at Microsoft with products like Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, and Windows Azure;
- I can handle crazy period of the years, but not for many weeks straight without taking time for me;
- The things I'm enjoying the most in this role are: networking, public speaking, travelling, helping, and sharing with others;
- I miss coding, as I feel I didn't code enough since I stop being a freelancer;
- ...

It has been a great year, and I'm looking forward to an even better one.

_P.S.: I like this picture. Can you guess what I was saying to the attendees of [Mobiz](https://mtldgtl.com/en/mobiz/)? OK I don't remember it, but it's funny what people said when they saw this picture on Facebook._
