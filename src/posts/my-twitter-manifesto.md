I was talking with the friend [Christian Heilmann](https://christianheilmann.com) the other day, and he was highlighting the fact that it's important today to have [a Twitter manifesto](https://christianheilmann.com/2013/02/11/hello-it-is-me-on-twitter/), or a place where followers can refer about what you do, what you won't do, and what can happen if they follow you on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fharper). Since I'm always transparent on how I manage my online life, I thought it was a good idea to do one too, so here it is.

## What I'm doing on Twitter

- Aside from my blog, Twitter is one of my favorite social media, so I use it a lot. That means that I tweet a lot, and often.
- I tweet about anything, and everything: technical stuff, stuff I read, musics I like, videos I enjoyed, venues where I am, stupid thoughts, RT from others...
- I use it as a personal account, so it's not filtered: that means it's 100% me, like with everything I do.
- Twitter is also a source of great informations for me, so I'm reading a lot of what I see, so I'm filtering a lot my following.
- For me, Twitter is also about communicating with others, so I once in a while, have a good discussion over Twitter (that means a lot of tweets, back, and forth).

## What I won't do on Twitter

- I won't automatically follow you back if you follow me.
- [I'm not following a lot of people](https://fred.dev/how-im-managing-my-social-media-connections/ "How I’m managing my social media connections") as I prefer to get quality content than too much noise. Even if I know you in person, that doesn't mean I'll follow you.
- My tweets aren't, and will never be any official statements or neither an official channel from my employer.
- I'm not a marketing channel, so even if I tweet about something my employer did, it's because I found it was awesome. Same for any company, even about competitors.
- I won't promote your stuff if you ask me too on Twitter. I'm always happy to help other with my network, and reach, but I won't just promote something for the sake of promoting it. [Send me an email](mailto:fharper@oocz.net "Fred’s tees #23 – Melting Rubik’s Cube"), give me some meat, and we'll see: it needs to fit me, and I won't promote something I don't know or don't believe in. At the end, [bloggers (or people on Twitter) aren't cheap labor](https://fred.dev/i-am-a-blogger-not-cheap-labor/ "I am a blogger, not cheap labor")...

## It's your choice

At the end, you have the choice to follow me or not. I use Twitter in a way that make sense for me, so if you think I tweet too much, if you are upset because I don't follow you or unfollowed you, or if you don't like my personal tweets, you have the power to unfollow me. That sounds rude or pretentious, but trusts me, it's just a conclusion I came with a couple of years ago: you cannot please everyone, and [I won't change to please other](http://fred.dev/my-life-manifesto-v2/ "My life manifesto v2").

I have the intention to update this manifesto once in a while. Do you have a Twitter manifesto? Do you think it's important to have one? Share your thoughts!
