Success means different thing for each of us. Some are looking to get more money to buy the things they liked, for others it’s all about raising a family, or being successful in their career, or a mix of many goals.

From the top of my 30 years old, I had a lot of failures, but also many successful moments: family, friends, career, personal projects… I found that there is a clear pattern in these successful achievements: there is always one, and only one key that take you to the finish line successfully, and mostly everybody seems to keep it secret! **It’s you, it’s all about you…** It’s about what you do. It’s about how you think. It’s about how you act. I’m a big believer of being the owner of my destiny. I’m acting like this since I understood it, and life has been good for me.

If you’re not happy with your job, find a new one. If you want more money, find a way to make more money. If you want to travel… travel! There is nothing you can’t do. Oh, but most of the time, you’ll need to go out of your comfort zone, as this is where the magic happens. You’ll need to tell the Flinch to shut up, and do what you want to do for real. You’ll fail. Everybody does, but you’ll have way more successful happy ending because you tried.

You are the only person between you, and your goals. The key to happiness, to be successful, and to achieve your goal, is nothing more than yourself. It’s not your boss's fault if you don’t like your job. It’s not your company's fault if you are not making enough money. Get over it, and stop blaming others, the key to being successful is you! I cannot repeat myself enough on this topic. I’m tired to read bullshit about being successful… Do, be, make things happen… be successful because you want it, because you can! **How do you define being successful for yourself? Are you in control of your destiny? Share your thoughts!**
