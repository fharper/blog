![](images/6346609079_aae53a2270_b.jpg "6346609079_aae53a2270_b")Usually, when I'm doing a blog post, I'm searching on [Flickr for a picture or image with a Creative Commons license](https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=&l=comm&ss=2&ct=6&mt=photos&w=all&adv=1). So last week, I was looking for one to put into my blog post around HTML5 resources and I saw this one: a _sexy_ (sexy?) picture of [Bruce Lawson](https://www.brucelawson.co.uk/), one of the two authors of a HTML5 book. One month ago, [I found the picture](https://fred.dev/scary-html5-book-promotion/ "Scary HTML5 book promotion") of [Remy SharpI wonder if it's these pictures that motivated](https://remysharp.com/) [Bristowe](https://bristowe.com/) to buy this book a couple of months ago for the team... By the way, you can buy their book [Introduction to HTML5 second edition](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0321784421/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=outofcomzon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=0321784421).
