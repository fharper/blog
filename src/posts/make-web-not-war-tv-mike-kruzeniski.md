Here is another interview I did for my [never born project](https://fred.dev/make-web-not-war-tv-an-unfinished-project/ "Make Web Not War TV – An unfinished project"), [Make Web Not War](https://web.archive.org/web/20130628080719/http://www.webnotwar.ca/) TV, at the [Web à Québec](https://webaquebec.org/) (website in French). I had the pleasure, on the first evening of the event, to interview [Mike Kruzeniski](http://kruzeniski.com/), Design Lead at Twitter, who was a colleague before as a Principal Design Lead on the Windows Phone team at Microsoft. We talked about Modern UI (used to be call Metro UI), content before chrome, tips for developers who wants to make a good design, and more.

Are you a designer, or a developer? Do you like great design? Any good example? Any tips for people like me who suck at design? Share your thoughts.
