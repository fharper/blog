The year is not yet done that I'm starting to pack my speaking agenda for the next one. In January, [I'll be in Toronto to talk about Firefox OS](https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Startups-TO/events/152828322/) at the [Mobile Startups TO user group](https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Startup-TO/).

On January 8, join me, and the most dynamic folks in the startups' ecosystem of Toronto to learn more about Firefox OS, and the opportunity for startups at the Mozilla office. It's nearly free as the 5$ you'll pay will go into food, and drinks, so you won't have to worry about grabbing something quick from the office to the event. Here is the description of my presentation

As a startup, looking forward to growing the reach, and to improve the sustainability of your product is one key to success. What’s better as a platform than the web itself?  In this talk, Frédéric Harper, Senior Technical Evangelist at Mozilla, will show you how you can use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to build amazing mobile applications as to brush up what you previously published. Learn about the open web technologies, including WebAPIs, and Web Activities, which enhance the developers’ toolbox. Let’s not forget the tools designed to get you started developing HTML apps for Firefox OS, and the web.

As usual, I'm counting on you to make this more of a discussion, than a presentation. So friends of Toronto who likes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the open web (or just wants to learn more about those), [reserve your spot right away](https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Startups-TO/events/152828322/) as we have a limited number of seats! See you in 2014 Toronto friends!
