I often get asked what to do when someone is visiting my city for the first time, so here is a quick, opinionated, far from complete list of must in Montréal. Keep in mind that winter is really cold here: it can go as low as -30C (-22F) so I suggest you visit during the summer if you can. We are a welcoming city and most people are bilingual, so speaking English will get you anywhere in the city.

## Food

- Eat poutine at [La Banquise](http://labanquise.com/en/). Some locals are saying that it's overrated, but I still think it's the best place to try this local, non-healthy specialty: take a regular one (French fries, curd cheese and gravy - that's it).
- Eat a smoke-meat sandwich at [Schwartz's Deli](http://www.schwartzsdeli.com/). It is not that disgusting thing in the US called corned beef. You'll have the full experience at the original restaurant - not the take-out next to it - and it's cash only (they have an ATM inside). It's a small restaurant, and there is often a long line-up.
- Eat bagels at [St-Viateur Bagel](http://www.stviateurbagel.com/) or [Fairmount Bagel](https://fairmountbagel.com/). I know you already had bagels, but you never had a good one, trust me!
- Eat a beaver's tail at [Queues de Castor](http://beavertails.com/). It's a dessert, and obviously, not from real beaver. They have multiple locations in the city.

## Restaurants / Bars / Coffee Shops

- [Benelux Verdun](http://www.brasseriebenelux.com/wellington) - the service is slow, but it’s a nice terrace in the west of Montréal. Go there in the summer.
- [Dieu du Ciel](https://dieuduciel.com/en/) - A must for craft/microbrewery beer.
- [Gibeau Orange Julep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibeau_Orange_Julep) - a landmark in Montréal.
- [L'Auberge du Dragon Rouge](http://oyez.ca/aubergedudragonrouge/) - Old French restaurant/bar. You go there for the "show".
- [L'île Noire Pub](http://ilenoire.com/) - Scotches & gin, best places to try the good stuff.
- [La Distillerie](https://www.pubdistillerie.com/) (3 locations) - Cocktails served in Mason jars.
- [Le Sainte-Élisabeth](http://www.ste-elisabeth.com/) - four-walled terrace, accessible during Spring and Autumn.
- [Terrasse Nelligan](http://terrassenelligan.com/home/) - overpriced, but one of the best terrace views in town.

## Museums

- [Montréal Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/) - fine arts museum.
- [Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal](https://macm.org/en/) - contemporary arts museum.
- [Pointe-à-Callière](https://pacmusee.qc.ca/en/) - Montréal archeological and history museum.

## Activities

- [L'International des Feux Loto-Québec](https://www.laronde.com/larondeen/linternational-des-feux/overview) - Summer weekly fireworks. You don't need to buy a ticket - they are blocking the Notre-Dame street so people can watch them from there.
- [Orchestre symphonique de Montréal](https://www.osm.ca/en/home-osm/): if you like classical music, our orchestra is world-renowned.
- [Piknic Électronik](http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/en/piknic-electronik-electro-music-montreal/) - electronic music every Sunday (summer only).
- [Tam-Tams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam-Tams) - every Sunday during summer time, people go there to play tam tam together. If you don't smoke weed or don't like the smell (like me!), be warned...
- [Wiggle Room](http://wiggleroom.ca/) - Burlesque show. I never went there, it's on my list since forever, but I heard great things about it.
- We also have a lively [gay village](https://www.montrealgayvillage.com/) with many bars, restaurants, and karaoke.

## Points of interest

- [Atwater Market](https://www.marchespublics-mtl.com/en/marches/atwater-market/) - If you want to shop locally food and drinks-wise, it's the best market we have.
- [Clock Tower](http://www.oldportofmontreal.com/attraction/clock-tower) - Located in the old port, it's a great spot to take a break of walking in the city, and enjoy sangria during summer time. If you have kids, there's a lot of activities in the Old Port (check the [kids' section](#kids-activities)).
- [Jean-Talon Market](https://www.marchespublics-mtl.com/en/marches/jean-talon-market/) - Not as hyped as the Atwater market, but some would say it's less overrated.
- [La Fontaine Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Fontaine_Park) - Great park, go there with friends for a BBQ or just relaxing while reading a book.
- [Mount Royal mountain](https://www.lemontroyal.qc.ca/en) - Perfect for some time in nature and some easy hiking.
- [Old Port](http://www.oldportofmontreal.com/) - Nice area with old buildings, tourist restaurants (read expensive) and many activities during summer time.
- [Saint Joseph's Oratory](https://www.saint-joseph.org/en/) - If you are religious or just like church architecture.

Some of those activities are good for kids only, but most are fun for all ages.

- [Botanical Garden](http://espacepourlavie.ca/en/botanical-garden) - maybe less interesting for kids, but each year between September and October, there is the [lights and lanterns festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJO4QXe7aHM) which kids, and adults will love for sure.

[Public transit](http://www.stm.info/en) is quite easy to use, but [Uber](https://www.uber.com/global/en/cities/montreal/) is available here. Montréal is a safe city, so you don't have to worry, but as with anywhere in the world, don't let your things unsupervised, and lock the doors. I'll try to update this list as often as possible and fellow Montréalers, feel free to suggest additions to my list. Lastly, please let me know when you are in town so we can meet.
