[![WP_20130424_001](images/WP_20130424_001.jpg)Seriously? I mean, the wall painting was not beautiful, and now, they added some distaff to fit the wall. At least, if it was for kids I would understand, but there is nothing there for kids: no toys, no sand, no water fountain... I pass in front of this quite often, and I rarely see people enjoying the precious moment they have in this _wonderful_ swamp, and of course, our taxes probably paid this!](http://fred.dev/content/uploads/2013/06/WP_20130424_001.jpg)

[P.S.: For those not in Montreal, Verdun is the neighborhood in which I live in Montreal.](http://fred.dev/content/uploads/2013/06/WP_20130424_001.jpg)
