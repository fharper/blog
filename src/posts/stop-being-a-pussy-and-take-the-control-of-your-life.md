"Stop being a pussy and take the control of your life" is what I want to say each time I heard negative people talking about their life. OK, it may be sound rude, but I try not to be negative in my life and these people, don't help me. By experience, if you want to take the control of your life, you can do it.

You are not happy with your job, change for a new one. There are plenty of companies that are looking for their next employee. Of course, it's a chance to get, maybe the job will be worst, but maybe it will be the best one you ever had.

You are not happy with your boyfriend, spouse or common-law, quit him/her. Yes, it's not easy. Yes you will hurt the other one, but it's your life. You don't have to be mad the rest of it because you don't want to hurt others.

You are too fat and it's not good for your health. Stop complaining about the genetic. Start eating well and make some exercises (I can make this kind of statement, since I'm fat!).

OK, you understand my point. Whenever is it, you can take the control of your life starting for this boring meeting you don't want to attend up to your conjugal life. It's YOUR life, not the life of the others and let me tell you a secret, you only have one (OK, in my religion. It's only one. Yours can differ). Don't get me wrong, it's not as easy as it seems. It's not always black and white. Sometimes you need to make a difficult choice to change things, and sometimes you also need to lose one thing to get another one. It's a long road until you get used to it, but it's always a winning situation.

Trust me, I used to live like this since a couple of years. It's not perfect and I'm not perfect for executing it, but I complain a lot less about "my life" than before. I'm also doing what I really want, meet the people I want, do the job I want... **And you, are you trying to make your life better by taking the control of it or do you think I'm a complete idiot?**
