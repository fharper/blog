I know, I'm doing it a lot. I read a blog post, and I'm not leaving a comment to the author. There are so many things to read on the Internet, and so many other things to do that I don't have time to leave comments. But I'm wrong! People are taking the time to share something with me, and I should let them know if I enjoyed it.

I know, it's the same for this blog. I have many readers, but not a lot of comments. Is it because people don't like what I'm sharing with them? I don't think so as I often got good comments about my blog, but in-person. Is it because my content is not engaging? I'm sure not, as I also have great discussions with people, in-person, on some of the topics I'm sharing here.  I think it's a matter of time. We are now used to real time information. We are now trained to share our ideas with the rest of the world... in 140 characters. Don't get me wrong, Twitter is my favorite social media, after the blog. I like to share quickly what I'm thinking about with my followers, but I like to blog as I can elaborate a lot more. It's also a lot easier to have a great discussions with people on different topics.

From now on, I'll take time to share more on other blogs that I'm reading, and I hope you'll do it too. Will it take me more time? Sure! Will I get some benefits from doing it? Of course! That will give me an opportunity to elaborate my thoughts. To create a relationship with the author, and other readers. To change my mind, if that makes sense, by having a healthy discussion. To find alternative ways to my actual thought. Last not least, to let the author know that I found his blog post valuable. I may have less time to read more things, but at the end, it will be more valuable.

**So, are you also the kind of people who read something interesting, and don't leave any comments? Do you take the time to discuss with someone who share his opinion on a subject that matter to you? Share your thoughts!**
