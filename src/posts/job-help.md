There is no secret there: the love, support, and help of the global tech community is one of the reasons I consider myself successful today. Recognizing it, I try to give back as much as I can. One of my pleasures is to use trust, reputation, and relationships to be a [trust agent](https://www.amazon.ca/Trust-Agents-Influence-Improve-Reputation-ebook/dp/B003VWCQBK/ "The book Trust Agents: Using the Web to Build Influence, Improve Reputation, and Earn Trust by Julien Smith and Chris Brogan"). Part of it is about helping others to find a job or a new employee. Since I get a lot of requests, here is how you can help me... helping you.

## Looking for a job or a contract?

There are two things I can do for you: sharing your profile publicly on LinkedIn, and Twitter or putting you in relation with someone I'm connected to at a company where there is an open position that is interesting for you. I rarely know someone hiring as when I'm not searching for work myself, I don't pay attention.

In any cases, I'll need your LinkedIn profile, and Twitter profile if you are there also (if not, it's fine, I'll still share it there, but won't be able to tag you). I'll also need a short but clear, and short description of what you are looking for.

## Looking for an employee?

First, if you are a recruiter or work for a recruiting company, for different reasons, this offer is not for you. For others, if you want my help, you need to have the job description available somewhere on the web . It can be on LinkedIn, on your site, or on a GitHub gist, I don't care. You'll have more chances to find good candidates if there is a URL where they can find some information about the role you are offering.

Once you have the information I need to help you, [send me an email](mailto:hi@fred.dev "Send me an email"), ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fharper) or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper), and I'll see if I can help. Keep in mind that there is no guarantee it will, but more visibility and new contacts cannot hurt.
