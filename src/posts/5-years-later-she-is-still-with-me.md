Today is the celebration of our 5 years together, as a couple.

Yes, after 5 years, I am still amazed by our couple as we are truly made for each other:

- She can be this perpetual student.
- I can be this social beast.
- She can be this movie snob.
- I can be this frequent traveler.
- She can be this experimented shopper woman.
- I can be this crazy guy.
- She can be this shoe freak.
- I can be this "involve everywhere" man.
- ...

We can be ourselves, and it's one of the reasons why we are still together, and so happy. Oh, and for those of you that were asking themselves why the pictures or my 5 years anniversary with my fiancé is a Storm Trooper one, it's because we are Geek: one of the thing we did to celebrate this special day, was to bought the complete Star Wars saga blue-ray edition. **What can I say more...**
