Yesterday I was invited to help support the [Athens App Days](https://appdaysathens2013.gr/). I did the first technical talk of the day, and my goal was to excited developers about the platform, and to show them all the possibilities they have for building their application. I was quite impressed by the dedication of developers during all the hackathon: they were hard at work to get a chance to win one of the amazing prizes we had!

I hope you enjoyed the presentation, and let me know if you still need help with the development of your Firefox OS app: I can't wait to see them in the marketplace! It was a real pleasure to be part of this event, and of course, to visit Athens for the first time.
