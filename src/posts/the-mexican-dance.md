![Mexico_dance](images/Mexico_dance.gif)[I was in Guadalajara](https://fred.dev/going-to-guadalajara-in-mexico-anything-a-tourist-should-do/ "Going to Guadalajara in Mexico, anything a tourist should do?") a couple of weeks ago for a Firefox OS workshop. I took two days off to visit the city, and for the first one, my friend, and colleague [Robert Nyman](https://robertnyman.com/) was with me, and made this amazing gif of me: they told me it was a Mexican tradition! OK, I'm just good on having fun, and making stupid things...
