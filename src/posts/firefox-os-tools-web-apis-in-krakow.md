[![fxos-krakow](images/fxos-krakow.jpg)Today I did two presentations at the Firefox Krakow workshop. The first one was an introduction to the tools you'll need to develop Firefox OS application: you don't need any special IDE, but you'll see that using the](http://fred.dev/content/uploads/2013/09/fxos-krakow.jpg) [Firefox OS simulator](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/), and the [Firefox Web Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) will help you a lot in developing your application.

**[Firefox OS tools, get your hands dirty](https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper/firefox-os-tools-get-your-hands-dirty "Firefox OS tools, get your hands dirty")** from **[Frédéric Harper](https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper)**

I also did a quick overview of the [Firefox OS Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI). My goal wasn't to make all attendees experts with Web APIs, but to fill their brain with them: it's usually what you avoid doing as a speaker, but in my case, I wanted them to know that they exist, and are easy to use. You may not need them for your Firefox OS application, but if it happens, you'll know they exist. I mostly wanted developers to know that we have awesome documentations on the Mozilla Developer Network they can refer to whenever they are looking for something.

Of course, slides are slides, they, by no mean, replace being at the presentation as they are only visual support: used them wisely! I'll try to record myself presenting them when I'll have free time (I forgot to start CamStudio when I was presenting). It was a real pleasure to visit Krakow, and Poland for the first time, and I hope the attendees got as excited as we are about Firefox OS. Remember, whether you were at the workshop or not, if you need any help with Firefox OS, [please email me](mailto:fharper@mozilla.com). Ping me also if you don't need help, but submitted an application to the marketplace, I want to see what you did!
