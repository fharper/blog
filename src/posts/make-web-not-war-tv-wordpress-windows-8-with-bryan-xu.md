Still part of the series of videos I did for the [Make Web Not War TV project I had](https://fred.dev/make-web-not-war-tv-an-unfinished-project/ "Make Web Not War TV – An unfinished project") when [I was at Microsoft](http://fred.dev/im-leaving-microsoft-looking-for-a-new-opportunity/ "I’m leaving Microsoft, looking for a new opportunity"), I did an interview at [Confoo](https://confoo.ca/en) with [Bryan Xu](https://twitter.com/_bryanxu) from [IdeaNotion](https://ideanotion.net/). I had the please to work with the guys at IdeaNotion for an [Open Source project](https://github.com/ideanotion/ideapress), [MetroPress (now IdeaPress)](https://ideapress.me/) that was helping people to build Windows 8 application from their Wordpress blog.

In this interview, we talked about MetroPress, Wordpress, Windows 8, and of course, his company. If you want a good company for your projects, hire them! I'm now back in the Web, and prefer to get the full experience of a Web site or Web application, but it was a good project for what we had to achieve at that time. On your side, did you use MetroPress? Are you building Windows 8 applications? What do you like or not from the OS? Are you using Wordpress? Share your thoughts.
