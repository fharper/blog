[![](images/20120319_182401.jpg "20120319_182401")](http://fred.dev/content/uploads/2012/03/20120319_182401.jpg)Some people think we need to be enemies. I'm one of the kind who think we should work together to make the Web a better place. So I was there tonight, at their Montreal office grand opening. Thanks for the invitation, you have a great office.

_P.S.: The other guy on the picture is [Benoit Piette](https://benoitpiette.com/), co-organizer of [HTML5mtl](https://www.meetup.com/HTML5mtl/).__P.S.2: Yeah a Microsoft guy, with a Twitter t-shirt, in a Google office..._
