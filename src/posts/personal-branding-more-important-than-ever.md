Yesterday, I did a talk at [Kongossa Web Series](https://www.kws-forum.org/?lang=en) about personal branding. It's a passion I have, and I really think it's more important than ever, so I want to spread the words to as many people as possible. It's why I was happy when the organizers asked me to talk about it in their first edition of the event in North America.

As usual, the slides are for the attendees, as it may not make sense if you weren't there. I also, recorded myself during my presentation so you can listen to me while following the slides (sorry for the audio quality). I recorded my presentation, but for some reason, I cannot do any editing in any software, and I can't publish in the actual format, that wouldn't serve the goal well. If you want, you can wait as the organizers recorded all sessions, and will put videos online, but it may not be soon: they plan to release about one presentation per month, so if you can't wait watch the presentation below.

Personally, thinking about me as a brand really helped me a lot: I went from developer to the Technical Evangelist I wanted to be. I usually do technical presentations, but since it's a pet peeve of mine, and that I'm not just about technical stuff; I enjoyed a lot doing this presentation. Actually, I'm looking for brand new opportunities to present this topic. For me, personal branding can help you achieve new goals, be that linchpin, and be successful! Did you attend my presentation? Did you like it? Any comments? Do you believe in personal branding? Do you think I'm just crazy? Do you have any personal story about it? Share your thoughts!
