A couple of weeks ago, I was asked by [Mathieu Laferrière](https://mathieulaferriere.com/ "Mathieu Laferrière website") to answer a couple of questions about the future of work. He was conducting interviews for the future of work project of [Bill Jensen](https://www.simplerwork.com/ "Bill Jensen website"). In this nine minutes video, I answered those questions:

1. What choices have made you... you?
2. The toughest challenges facing all leaders in leading other into the future \[of work\]?
3. How can we help those leaders make those tough choices?
4. Your biggest lessons learned?

I'm having a blast for the last couple of years: working at home, no schedule, doing something I like. I've never been so productive, and I hope this small interview will help employers to understand the benefits of being more open. I also hope that it will help you, find the thing you like to do for a living, and be happy when you wake up on Monday morning...
