I tend to have the bad habit of just posting my presentation on [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper) and not doing any blog post. Even if it’s better than the speakers who don’t publish them online, it’s not so easy for attendees that wanted to use the resources. I’ll be a better speaker with my next speaking engagements, and I will do a blog post with an easy access to the resources to help you get right now to the content.

Yesterday I did a talk at [Prairie Dev Con West](https://www.prairiedevcon.com/) on [WebMatrix](https://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/). I wanted to show how it’s easy to build awesome website and Web application with this amazing tool. Here are the slides from my presentation:

If you can see it, please open the blog post in a browser.

I didn’t have a lot of resources, but the one I gave them could lead to a good number of hours of pure fun:

- [Download WebMatrix](https://microsoft.com/web/webmatrix)
    
- [Download the beta version of WebMatrix](https://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/betafeatures.aspx)
    
- [Tutorials to explore the power of WebMatrix](https://www.asp.net/web-pages/overview/exploring-webmatrix)
    

As usual, if you have any questions on the tool, please let me know.
