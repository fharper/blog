In life, you need to choose your battles. Some are not worth your time, but obviously, some are. You fight them with time, and with energy. You have some high; you have some low. You fail, but you come back, stronger than ever. It's a scenario that can go on forever. Maybe it's time for you to evaluate the situation. As unpleasant it can be, you need to be honest with yourself! Is this battle still worth it? Was it set for failure since the beginning? Did the context changed? Maybe you lost the battle for the last time, and it's fine like this...
