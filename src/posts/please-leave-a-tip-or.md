God will know... Saw this tip "jar" at the [Daily Dozen Doughnut Company](https://www.yelp.ca/biz/daily-dozen-doughnut-company-seattle) last time I was in Seattle. It always makes me laugh. By the way, if you go to Seattle, take some time to go to the [Pike Place Market](https://www.yelp.ca/biz/pike-place-market-seattle), and be sure to order a bag of those yummy mini donuts, and why not accompany this with a good coffee from [the original Starbucks](https://www.yelp.ca/biz/starbucks-seattle-88).
