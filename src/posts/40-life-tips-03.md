![](images/tips-03.png)Being open-minded means welcoming new ideas or information. Especially if a priori, you disagree with them or they challenge your belief system. In a broader sense, it can also mean being favorable to new activities, food and anything that is unknown to you. I know, it is comforting to stick to what you believe or know, but being flexible is the best way to grow. It does not mean accepting every opinion once you hear them, nor dealing with toxic people. Like everything in life, it's about balance. Be more tolerant to new ideas. It will challenge you, but you'll live your life at its fullest!
