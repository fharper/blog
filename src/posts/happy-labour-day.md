I never really care about [Labour Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Day): for me, it was just another holiday. Of course, I always thought that it was to celebrate workers, to take time off from the hard work people are doing for someone's bread and butter, but I never really celebrate it. I read about the subject this morning, to learn a bit more on it. From the little I read, it was mostly to help workers who were exploited by companies with the help of unions, and at the end, to celebrate [work-life balance](https://fred.dev/work-hard-play-hard/ "Work hard, play hard"). On my side, I consider myself lucky to wake up every day to do what I like, and being paid for it. I think it's a privilege that not everybody has, so from this day forwards, the Labour Day for me will be that celebration. I don't think I will do anything special, but I'll at least take a moment to think about how lucky I am, and I'll continue to encourage people to [take the lead of their lives](https://fred.dev/now-is-the-perfect-moment/ "Now is the perfect moment"), and do what they want to do for a living. **Happy Labour Day everyone!**

P.S.: Thanks to [Mathieu HÃ©tu](http://mathieuhetu.com/) who gave me the permission to use one of his latest [Scrum Comics](http://mathieuhetu.com/?tag=scrum+meme). It's a regular comic that Mathieu put online to picture some interesting moment in the life of people who use scrum framework. Since I've done my ScrumMaster certification, and used it on some projects, I found his comics very funny. It happened that [this one](https://j.mp/19HLMId) was a wink to me...
