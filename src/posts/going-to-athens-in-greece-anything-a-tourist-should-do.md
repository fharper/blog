I like to travel, and I'm lucky enough to have a job that gives me this opportunity. After my [next trip to Budapest in Hungary](https://fred.dev/going-to-budapest-in-hungary-anything-a-tourist-should-do/ "Going to Budapest in Hungary, anything a tourist should do?") (by the way, I had no reply for this post, so feel free to give me some advices if you live or have been to Budapest), I won't come back at home: I need to make a stop to Athens in Greece to support a Firefox OS event there (more information on this as soon as I will have more). As usual, I'm asking my tribe to help me discover the world through the experience you had there.

I started to search for things I want to do in Athens, but I would like to know your thoughts about it! If you live there, you sure know what a tourist should do if he only has one or two days. If you've been there, you may get stuck in some tourist trap, and would like other, like me, to avoid those. I usually have four questions when I'm going somewhere new:

1. What is the best wireless cellphone provider in the country?
2. What are the typical dishes I want to eat?
3. What are the best coffee shops, and restaurants in the city?
4. What are the attractions I don't want to miss?

## What is the best wireless cellphone provider in the country?

I can't live without data, so usually the first thing I do in a new country is to buy a prepaid sim card with a data plan for the duration of my stay. It's less about my email, than the fact that I'm using GPS/Yelp a lot to find places, and navigate in unknowns streets. Of course, I like to do check-ins, and check my emails while on the road, but it's less important when I'm off.

## What are the typical dishes I want to eat?

Funny enough, I was quite difficult with food and today, IÂ  eat mostly everything. I like to taste special dishes or beverages as it's all tight with the culture. Even if I don't like it, I can at least say that I tried.

## What are the best coffee shops, and restaurants in the city?

One of the bad parts of traveling is that all your meals are at restaurants: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. To make the stay more pleasant, going to good restaurants is a must. It's why I always try to get suggestions as using services like Yelp. As for the coffee shops, they are my second office, after my home one. I always have my computer with me, and I just need an Internet connection, and I'm ready to go.

## What are the attractions I don't want to miss?

Of course, you don't travel only for coffee shops, and food! Is there anything special a tourist shouldn't miss? Do you know any special events that may happen when I'll be there? Is there any other places, maybe less known for foreign people, but worth a visit? I'm not difficult, but I prefer to visit or do stuff I wouldn't be able to do in my hometown. It could be a festival, a special part of the town, museum, a unusual shop, pyramids, zoo... Name it, everything that would give me the opportunity to have a great time, and come back at home with good memories as with a ton of pictures!

Don't get me wrong, those posts aren't a lazy move from me: I'll do my homework, and search for what I can do once I'll be in Athens, but getting feedbacks from other is much more interesting than a result on Google. I can't wait to see the amazing suggestions you'll tell me.
