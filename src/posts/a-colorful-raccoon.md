[![WP_20130203_013](images/WP_20130203_013.jpg)Since it's a busy time of the year, and that I don't have a lot of time for personal blogging, I figured out I would share with you a picture I took in Seattle last week. I like graffiti. Not those ugly "I am a gansta" one, and I want to pee on my territory, but those pieces of art like this amazing raccoon! It's now the picture of my lock screen.](http://fred.dev/content/uploads/2013/02/WP_20130203_013.jpg)
