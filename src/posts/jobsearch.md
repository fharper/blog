> I am now actively looking forÂ found my next challenge ðŸŽ‰: a place I'll be able to call home **for many years** to come. If you think you have a role for me, here is a cheat sheet for you to evaluate if I could be a great fit.

## **I want**

- a developer relations leadership role: open to discuss IC roles if the challenge is uber-awesome;
- a real challenge: I get bored easily so I cannot be _just_ another resource to do more of the same;
- certain freedom: I can't deal with micromanagement;
- trust: you hired me for a reason;
- diversification of the role: focus on writing content only is a technical writer job;
- enough people within -7 to -1 UTC (currently Daylight Savings, otherwise -8 to -2 UTC),Â  so I don't feel alone most of the day;
- a work-life balance: I love my job, but I'm not a workaholic.

## **I am**

- extrovert, passionate, outspoken, colorful, bold and [I tweet](https://twitter.com/fharper) a lot: it's part of the package deal;
- experienced: 20 years in tech with 10 in developer relations;
- pragmatic, but I have a preference for anything open source;
- not cheap: I am at a Bay Area director/principal level base salary-wise;
- working remotely for the last 10 years: this won't change now;
- more than happy to work with a product or technologies I don't know: I actually love that;
- really good at public speaking, making videos and creating real connections with developers.

## **I won't**

- relocate anywhere in North America, but open to everywhere else with proper support;
- be able to work for you remotely unless you have a Canadian entity or use a Professional Employer Organization (it's easy & cheaper than the former, here's [why](https://fred.dev/canada/));
- work at a startup which doesn't have at least a Series A;
- have goals that are too close to a dollar sign: developer relations is not sales or presales;
- have a technical focus on native mobile development (or Ionic framework) or any low-level programming languages;
- work for companies that do not align with my values:
    - any Facebook-owned companies (you know [why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook));
    - anything cryptocurrency related ([why](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-26/is-bitcoin-mining-worth-the-environmental-cost));
    - Amazon ([why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Amazon));
    - Basecamp ([why](https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5));
    - Coinbase ([why](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804));
    - New Relic ([why](https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2020/07/new-relic-ceo-scolds-employees-in-internal-memo-we-are-a-company-with-an-urgent-need-to-get-back-on-track.html));
    - Replit ([why](https://intuitiveexplanations.com/tech/replit/));
    - Stripe (multiple instances of [rescinded signed offers](https://twitter.com/jennleaver/status/1402972896184586244));
    - Uber (I'll write about how they screwed me up one day).
- work with people who do not like cats ðŸ¤£
