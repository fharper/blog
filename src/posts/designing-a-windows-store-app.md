Part of the first event [we](https://web.archive.org/web/20130628080719/http://www.webnotwar.ca/) did a couple of weeks ago in Toronto with our friends of [DevTO](https://devto.ca), [HTML5 Toronto](http://htmltoronto.ca/), and [JavaScript Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/torontojs/), I also did a presentation on how to design a Windows Store application. It was a mix of good practices for the UI, the UX, and the integration you should do with the Windows 8 features to give a great experience to your users.

I'm no way near to be a design expert (trust me, I suck to design beautiful applications), but as a developer, and a user, I know what makes a good experience, and I know when an application sucks. Developers tend to minimize the impact of the details by considering the fact that their application has all the amazing features a customer who needs. Let me tell you this: if your application is ugly, don't give me a good experience or have no integration with the platform, people won't use it. They will check for alternative, and you will lose aÂ user. So thanks again to [Matthew Potter](https://twitter.com/askMP) who recorded my afternoon second session ([my morning session](https://fred.dev/html5-windows-8-friends-with-benefits/ "HTML5 & Windows 8, friends with benefits")) at our installfest.
