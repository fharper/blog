HTML5 is a giant step in the right direction: it gives a lot more tools that developers need to create better experiences for users. The problem? It’s not there yet when it comes to web development for mobile devices. In this talk, Frédéric Harper will show you how you can use HTML, and JavaScript to build amazing mobile applications, and brush up what you published before. You’ll learn about the open web technologies, including WebAPIs, and tools designed to get you started developing HTML apps for Firefox OS, and the web.

That was the abstract of the presentation I did on Thursday at [PragueJS](https://www.praguejs.cz/ "PragueJS website"). My goal was to show JavaScript developers that the eternal question between native versus mobile web application can be answered differently. We, Mozilla, created Firefox OS to open the web to more people, and give a real web platform to users as to developers. By doing so, we created what we call the WebAPIs: those APIs give you the control over the hardware with HTML5. Here are the slides from my presentation. The recording of my presentation has been made by [Node5](https://node5.cz/ "Node5 website") and will be available soon.

With that in mind, I cannot see anything else than a bright future for the web...
