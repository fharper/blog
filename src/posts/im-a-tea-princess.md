In today's world, we can capture everything with our smartphones... even videos like this one! When my doctor told me I should drink less coffee, I had to find a replacement somehow, and I now like to drink tea (without caffeine) once in a while. I'm tired of having the choice between "English Breakfast" or the other _irresistible_ camomile, so I bought a little kit I can bring with me when I'm traveling. Thanks to [Anthony Bartolo](https://wirelesslyobsessed.com/) for recording this... I hate you with love Bartolo!

P.S.: Yeah, I'm expecting many people calling me Tea Princess in addition to my co-workers that were at the table with me at that time!
