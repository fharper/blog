In approximatively two weeks, I'll speak at the West Island Developers and Entrepreneurs Meetup (group doesn't exist anymore) about personal branding for developers. You know it's one of my passion, and I'm always willing to introduce people to the concept.

> Do you think personal branding is not for you? Why should you care about your brand? After all, it’s not like you are an actor or the lead singer for a rock band. In fact, it’s never been more important for you to think about yourself as a brand. Doing so will provide rocket fuel for your career. You’ll find better jobs or become the “go-to guy” in certain situations. You’ll become known for your expertise and leadership; people will seek your advice and point of view. You’ll get paid better to speak, write, or consult. As a developer, there are many tools you can use to scale, and this presentation will help you understand how to get visibility, make a real impact, and achieve your goal. No need to be a marketing expert or a personal branding guru: be yourself and get your dream job or get to the next level of your career.

I'm all about loving what you do, and it's how I decided to care about my personal brand. If you want to learn more about why, and how it could make a difference in your career, join us on July 29 at Peter Cashin Studios. Be sure to register on the meetup page of the group! See you soon!
