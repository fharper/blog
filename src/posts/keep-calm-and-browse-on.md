There are so many parodies of the [Keep calm, and carry on poster used in the Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On), and even if most of them are shitty, once in a while, I found a good one. A couple of weeks ago, the friend [Christian Heilmann](https://christianheilmann.com/) tweeted [about one](https://twitter.com/codepo8/status/362254737078366208) from the Mozilla assets: [Keep calm, and browse on](https://assets.mozillalabs.com/Graphics/Wallpapers/BrowseOn/). I thought it was brilliant, but I didn't like the gradient background. I tried to find a vector version, but wasn't able to find one, so my friend, [Valérie Doré](https://twitter.com/ValerieDore), made one just for me! She found the vector version of the Firefox logo, download the usual font used for this poster, and made two SVG versions: [one like the original asset](https://fred.dev/images/2013/08/firefoxkeep.svg), and [another one with a full circle](https://fred.dev/images/2013/08/firefoxkeepFullcircle.svg) (shown above). I now used it as my background, and plan to use it elsewhere. Thanks to Val for this amazing work, and [feel free to let her know about your appreciation of her work](https://twitter.com/ValerieDore) if you used it (or not).
