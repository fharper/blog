I’m not the best when it comes to write greetings, but I find it important. In this time of the year, where things slow down and for most of us, we have the opportunity to take some times with our families, I want to wish you a merry Christmas (or anything you celebrate).

It’s the Holidays season and most of you are probably on vacations. Take some times with your family and with your friends. Try to relax, see what 2011 was made of and what 2012 will be for you. Take some time for yourself and do things you love. Be with the ones you love!

On my side, my plans are exactly what I suggested you: take some time for me, slow down, take some quality time with my lovely girlfriend and work on some projects, like this blog. **I wish you all a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.**
