One thing that is awesome with my job is that our team is all about learning and getting better. I’m the kind of guy who think there is things I need to learn by myself, on my own time, but other things that my employer need to pay for it in a form or in other: training, time… What is even greater in my role is that even things I would do all by myself, my manager invest time and money on!

One of the things we did to improve ourselves on a personal plan, that will also help our team work, is reading the book Strengths Finder 2.0 (version of the book, no link with Web 2.0). It’s not that our team is not playing well together, we are an amazing team, but there is always space to improvement everywhere in life. Usually books or people told you to find your weakness and try to work on them. You must admit that it’s a lot of work to being a better person. The main idea of this book is to work on your strength instead of your weakness. You have powerful aptitudes, why not taking them to the next step?

[Strengthsfinder 2.0: From the Author of the Bestseller Wellbeing](https://www.amazon.ca/Strengthsfinder-2-0-Author-Bestseller-Wellbeing/dp/159562015X%3FSubscriptionId%3D0JTCV5ZMHMF7ZYTXGFR2%26tag%3Doutofcomzon-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D159562015X)

The best thing about this book is actually not the book: it’s the online test you can take to find your top strengths. Knowing yourself help you in every sphere of your life, and I’m one of the kinds that knows pretty well is strengths and weakness. What was great with the test for me is that the results were exactly what I was expecting and how other are seeing me. If you want to know, here are my top five strengths/themes:**Woo**

People who are especially talented in the Woo theme love the challenge of meeting new people and

winning them over. They derive satisfaction from breaking the ice and making a connection with

another person.

**Activator**

People who are especially talented in the Activator theme can make things happen by turning

thoughts into action. They are often impatient.

**Strategic**

People who are especially talented in the Strategic theme create alternative ways to proceed. Faced

with any given scenario, they can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues.

**Connectedness**

People who are especially talented in the Connectedness theme have faith in the links between all

things. They believe there are few coincidences and that almost every event has a reason.

**Communication**

People who are especially talented in the Communication theme generally find it easy to put their

thoughts into words. They are good conversationalists and presenters.

I highly suggest you buy this book, even if it’s only to have access to the test (you got an unique code to be able to make the test online). **On your side, are you focusing on your strengths or weakness? Do you believe that working on our strengths is the way to go? Share your thoughts.**
