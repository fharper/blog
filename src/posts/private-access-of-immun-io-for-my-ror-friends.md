I'm in the middle of my third weeks at [IMMUNIO](https://www.immun.io/ "Immun.io website"), and I'm having a blast. I tried our product, and I'm so excited about it, that I want to give a privileged access to my Ruby on Rails friends.

Firstly, why would you want to use our private beta? [IMMUNIO](https://www.immun.io/ "Immun.io website") is a real-time protection you can add to your application in literality two minutes. Trust me, I thought it was, with all respect to my marketing friends, some kind of selling bullshit, but it's not. You just need to add our gem to your web application, and you instantly get our piece of software to protect your application from attacks like brute forcing, SQL injection, shell command execution and more. I know you are a good developer, but between you and me, did you took as much time as needed to secure your masterpiece!? I know I didn't...

I have a limited number of access to give, so send me an email at [fharper@immun.io](mailto:fharper@immun.io?Subject=Private RoR access) if you want one. Even if it's stable, you need to understand it's a beta version. I will also prioritize developers who have time to use it in a real application, even if it's only in staging. I would also love to get your feedback on the experience.

P.S.: For my Python friends using Django, you can still drop me a line as we'll have the private beta available soon.
