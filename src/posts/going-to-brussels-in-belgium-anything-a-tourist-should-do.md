As I did with my first visit in Seattle, and the [one in Krakow](https://fred.dev/going-to-krakow-in-poland-anything-a-tourist-should-do/ "Going to Krakow in Poland, anything a tourist should do?"), I'm asking my friends, and network what to do. Unfortunately, I didn't have as much time as I wanted in Krakow (I had to work since [my week before wasn't very productive](https://fred.dev/be-strong-for-the-ones-you-love/ "Be strong for the ones you love")), and didn't plan anything specific when I was [in San Jose last week](http://fred.dev/mobile-first-at-web-and-php-conference/ "Mobile First at Web and PHP Conference"), but trust me, I'm taking two days off in Brussels to visit this beautiful city.

I know Belgium is the place for food as I have on a list some specific things I want to taste: French fries, chocolate, waffle, and some tasty local beers that we don't have the chance to drink here. For sure, I'll need to do a lot more exercise during this trip as it won't be good for the belly! If you ever went in Brussels, any places I should not miss? Any restaurant I really need to try? Any specific beer I should drink? Any museum I should buy a ticket for? I may have some time during the [Mozilla Summit](https://summit.mozilla.org/) to visit a little, but I prefer to plan for the nearly two days I'll have off there. I'll also do my own research, but I consistently like to ask my network too, and build on top of others experience. Of course, I'll try to do at least [one or two geocaches there](https://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=fharper), and just walk in the town, without any specific destination: it's always a good way to find less-known area.

Again, I'm very lucky to have the latitude to do this with my job, but trust me; my employer doesn't loose on this. Before I forget, if you have any suggestion when it comes to cellphone data providers while I'm there, I'll need to buy a sim card: I can't live without data! So anything I should do? Any good or bad experience you had there? Any recommendations? Share your thoughts!
