In March, I was in Toronto for a Windows 8 event that [DevTO](https://www.devto.ca/), [HTML5 Toronto](http://htmltoronto.ca/), and [JavaScript Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/torontojs/) made in collaboration with us, [Make Web Not War](https://www.webnotwar.ca/). The event was a mix of installfest, hackathon, and some presentations. I started the day with an introduction to Windows 8, and how to build amazing applications with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. As I like to scale online with in-person events, I was happy to see that [Matthew Potter](https://twitter.com/AskMP) was streaming the event online, and kept a copy for on-demand viewing. Let's start this Monday with some Windows 8 love with my always sexy English accent!
