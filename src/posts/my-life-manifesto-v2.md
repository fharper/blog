Nearly two years ago, I did a blog post about [my life manifesto](http://fred.dev/my-life-manifesto/). It was a way for me to "put on paper" the guidelines for my life: who I'll be, what I'll do, and how I'll do it. Those six elements were very useful as I kept them in mind in every situation, and every moment in my life.  Today, I feel the need to update my manifesto with new reality, and to reflect where I am in my life now.

So here are the pillars of my life:

1. Be authentic;
2. Be regretless;
3. Do epic shit;
4. Go out of your comfort zone.

## What changed?

I don't believe in big plans: they usually contain too much, and it's hard to stick to it. Let's do one thing, but do it well, so I tried to simplify my manifesto by going from six points to four. I removed "do what you love", not because I don't believe about this anymore: it's implicitly part of the "do epic shit" one. I don't believe you can do something epic if you don't love what you do. If you read that blog for a while, you certainly know that I don't care about what others think of me: if you like me, of course, I'll be happy. If you don't like me, I don't care, because it's who I am, and I won't change for you. So I removed the "don't care about the others" for two reasons. The first one, if you are authentic, it means you don't need to change for others; you are who you are. For me, you are just yourself, whether it please other or not. I also thought that the connotation was quite negative: I'm no way near an anarchist. I, as well, changed "do it" to "do epic shit". Doing something is one thing: doing something amazing is another. Doing epic shit, imply that you need to do stuff. Last, but not least, I tried to keep my manifesto positive, so I changed "have no regrets" to "Be regretless".

Let me explain a little more what those points mean for me as it may have changed a little from the first version of my life manifesto.

## Be authentic

It's really about being yourself, in every situation. Don't change for others. You are who you are, and if people don't like you that way, you may not hang with the right people. Somewhere, there are people that like you exactly how you are.

## Be regretless

This one is tricky, as there are many definitions of regrets. My meaning is about stuff I didn't do. I prefer to have remorse because I did something wrong, then having regret to haven't done something. I have one big regret in my life, and it haunts me constantly.

## Do epic shit

If my manifesto wasn't all about positive stuff, I would also be able to say: don't be average. You can be awesome in every part of your life, personal or professional. The sky is the limit, and maybe not! Do stuff, make shit happen, and make it epic.

## Go out of your comfort zone

You know this one was coming, hence the title of this blog. There is your comfort zone, and there is were the magic happen. Guess what, there aren't at the same place. If you want to succeed, if you want to live your life, if you want to grow, you need to go out of your comfort zone. I would be far from were I am now in life if I had  always stayed in my comfort zone.

Do you have a life manifesto? Do you plan to make one? What do you think of my four rules? Share your thoughts!
