One day, I was at the gym, and my inner voice was all about "I hate that shit. It's hard to get in shape. I don't have enough time to come here. It's not easy to lose weight. I didn't eat very well for years: it's a difficult habit to leave behind.". It was like this for the entire time I was doing one of my exercise, but I saw an old man: this man was probably around 70, and he was doing the same exercise as me without complaining. He understood that it was the thing to do to live longer, and with a good health. At that exact moment, I told myself how stupid I was, and just shut up: I had **NO** excuses!

Most of the time, our reasons not to do something we should do aren't real one: we are our own gate to success. Of course, it's not easy to find a new job. It's not easy to lose some weight. It's not easy to go talk to that girl you like in the office. It's not easy to do your homework instead of playing some video games. Name all situations you want, if you take a moment, and be really honest with yourself, you'll see that most of the time, the only thing or person preventing you for making it happen... is you! Nobody said that life should be easy, but you have the power to make it yours, and go out of your comfort zone to do what you have to do. When you aren't doing something like going to the gym (I hate the gym so much), the only thing you do, is lying to yourself. It's so true that it hurt when you think about it!

So next time you are finding excuses for not doing something that you should do, ask yourself (I'll do too): are those real reasons, or am I trying to justify my lack of strength, and will?

P.S.: I think this image can shame all of us...
