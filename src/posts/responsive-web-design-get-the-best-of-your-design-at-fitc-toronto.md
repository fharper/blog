Yesterday I did a presentation at [FITC Toronto](https://www.fitc.ca/events/about/?event=124) on [Responsive Web Design](https://www.fitc.ca/events/presentations/presentation.cfm?event=124&presentation_id=1905). I had a blast with an amazing audience, and as I promised, here is the presentation:

Somebody introduce me to what seems to be an awesome tool to test your website on different devices. I didn’t have the time to test it, but [ProtoFluid](https://protofluid.com/) is a JavaScript library that you add to your project to be able to test your Web application or website on “different devices”.

I hope you enjoyed the presentation, and if you have any comments, questions or insults, let me know in the comment section.
