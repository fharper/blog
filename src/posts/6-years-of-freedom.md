It's been six years today that we are officially together, and a little more than five that we are engaged (for my friends outside of Qu√©bec, it's a common practice here). [I wrote about it last year](https://fred.dev/5-years-later-she-is-still-with-me/ "5 years later, she is still with me"), and I'll do it again right now: the secret of our couple is that we can be ourselves. It's also because of the freedom we give to each others. I can be myself of course, but I can do what I want to do. There is no grumpy woman at home when I go out to play badminton for the second time of the week, nor when I'm going out for a beer some beers with friends or not even a rebuke when I'm traveling, again, for work. Those are the things I like to do, and she respects this. On the other side, there is no frustrated Fred when she has many events to cover for [the blog she is writing for](http://www.pieuvre.ca/author/eplante/) (in French), nor any jealous boyfriend when she goes out with friends. We live together, but we also let the other half live his/her life with the things he likes to do, and we don't even force ourselves. There is no obligation to like all the same things or to do everything together, and it's perfect like this.

It's been six years today, and I'm looking for many more celebrations like this one.
