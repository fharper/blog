No? Why not? It makes sense if you find the item too expensive? It also makes sense if you find that the company or the entire industry make too much money. No?

It’s been a while since I’m thinking about writing this blog post. I’m tired of people who tell me that I should watch movies for free because it cost me too much since I watch a lot of them. I’m tired of people who tell me that I should find a torrent file to get my hand on this expensive software that I will use only once in a while. I’m tired of people that tell me I’m stupid to buy my music as I would be able to get the albums for free on the Internet.

If I cannot afford something, I don’t buy it. If I feel that I’m spending too much because I consume a lot, I put a limit, and minimize my expenses. If you steal something, no matter the reason, you are a thief. For me, there is no different with the person who go to a physical store to steal something, and the person who downloads a movie, a song, a software or whatever that it should have bought.

So next time you suggest to someone to pirate something or do it yourself, please go to a store, and steal something physical. After this, you’ll earn the right to tell us this…
