What happen when you listen to music? You feel happy or sad? Are you ready to conquer the world or just find the energy to finish that gym training? You remember the love of your life or that time when you were in that small coffee shop on a sunny day in Paris? Some songs are highly tight with specific memories or part of our life. Some others are just songs of the moment: they energize you, make you sad, relax you or make you smile.

I'm a huge music fan. There is not a day where I'm not listening to something. Music has a big influence in my life, and it's not going to change. I started to share some songs on this blog that are either important for me or give me strong feelings, and I would like to continue to do it. On that note, feel the power of only one song with this video of Learn to fly from the Foo Fighters created by 1000 musicians in Italy.
