![](images/tips-02.png)I'm serious! Get toxic people out of your life, and the sooner the better! You can try, **once**, to resonate with them, and explaining to them why you feel they aren't good for you. Explained in a proper way, the message can pass: if it doesn't, it's the green light you were waiting for. After all, there is a slight change that what they do or say that hurt you weren't intentional. That tip is good for everyone. Your boss is toxic? Time to find a new job, if possible, of course. Your parents are toxic? I know, it's hard as they are indeed, your parents, but unfortunately, not all parents are good ones . Your boyfriend or girlfriend is toxic? Again, not something you can do without any pain, but the goal is worth the trouble, trust me! So be honest with yourself, find them, and [get rid of them](https://fred.dev/toxic/)...
