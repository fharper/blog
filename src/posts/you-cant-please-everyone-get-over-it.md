If you don't like me, I don't care. This is an attitude I took a couple of years ago for one simple reason: I am who I am, and I won't change for you. I learnt a long time ago that you can't please everyone...

Some people won't like you. Some people will disagree with your opinion. Some people will find your latest blog post stupid. Some people will laugh about you because you like this type of music. What will you do about it? Change your taste, who you are, what you do, and how you think? Bullshit, it's OK not to please everyone! Just get over it, as the worst person in this situation, is the person who is not please with you. You shouldn't care as long as you stay true to yourself! Find the most loved artist, personality, musician, politician, actor or anyone else, and you'll find people that don't like them, or don't like their art. It's a fact, and you can't change it, so stop worrying about things you shouldn't worry about: you don't need others' approbation to be yourself.

Once you understand it's your life, and there is no way to pleased everyone, be yourself, and I promise that your life will be much better...
