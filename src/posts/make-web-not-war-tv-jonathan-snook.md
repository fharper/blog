![Snook_and_Fred](images/Snook_and_Fred.png)Part of the series of interviews I did for [the project I had, a Make Web Not War TV](https://fred.dev/make-web-not-war-tv-an-unfinished-project/ "Make Web Not War TV – An unfinished project"), I also had the pleasure to talk with [Jonathan Snook](https://snook.ca/), at the [Web à Québec](https://webaquebec.org/) (they had an interesting line-up of international speakers). Of course, we talked about CSS, HTML, his book [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/)

Do you enjoy new CSS features? Did you read Jonathan's book? Do you have any best practices for CSS? Share your thoughts.

_P.S.: I try not to publish posts in the same series consecutively, but I'm in Toronto for a team offsite, and didn't have the time to write a more complete post for today._
