I'm thrilled to announce that my book on personal branding for developers is now available at Apress: [Success in Programming, How to Gain Recognition, Power, and Influence Through Personal Branding](https://www.apress.com/9781484200025 "Personal Branding for Developers book"). After many hours of writing, editing, pages deleted, I can't be more proud of that book. It's my way to share with you my experience, my success, my failures, and everything that will help you to be successful in your career, no matter what successful means to you. Note that the book is primarily targeted to developers, but can be useful to any technical person or anyone who can do abstraction of specifics examples for software engineers.

Starting now, you can buy a printed version or a digital one on different sites like [Apress](https://www.apress.com/9781484200025 "Personal Branding for Developers book"), [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Success-Programming-Recognition-Influence-Personal/dp/1484200020/ "Personal Branding for Developers book"), [Amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/Success-Programming-Recognition-Influence-Personal/dp/1484200020/ "Personal Branding for Developers book") (printed version in Canada will be available soon - you can pre-order now), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/success-in-programming-frederic-harper/1120347619 "Personal Branding for Developers book"), [Kobo](https://store.kobobooks.com/en-CA/ebook/success-in-programming "Personal Branding for Developers book"), [Springer](https://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/book/978-1-4842-0002-5 "Personal Branding for Developers book") and more. Unfortunately, I have no way to know where the book is physically available, so you best bet is to order it online: the best deal I found was [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Success-Programming-Recognition-Influence-Personal/dp/1484200020/ "Personal Branding for Developers book"). I'll try to make a small event in Montréal for those of you who would like to celebrate with me, and have their book signed.

I would like to thank everyone who helped me in that project, with a special thanks to my parents and Émilie. I also would like to thanks my friends who were amazing, as usual, and let me share their thoughts about personal branding directly in the book. It's because of people like you that I'm where I am today: Christian Heilmann, Jonathan LeBlanc from PayPal, David Walsh from Mozilla, Jeffrey Zeldman, and Rey Bango from Microsoft.

I don't ask this often, but feel free to share the link to my book within your network, and leave a review on Amazon: it will be much appreciated! I won't get rich with this, trust me, but the more developers (and anyone) will know about personal branding, the more people will be happy on Mondays... I can't wait to get your comments on my first book! Now stop reading this post, and [get your copy](https://www.amazon.com/Success-Programming-Recognition-Influence-Personal/dp/1484200020/ "Personal Branding for Developers book") :)
