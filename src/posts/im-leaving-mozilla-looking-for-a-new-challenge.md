January 1st (or before if needed) will be my last day as a Senior Technical Evangelist at Mozilla. I truly believe in the Mozilla's mission, and I'll continue to share my passion for the open web, but this time, as a volunteer. From now on, I'll be on the search for a new challenge.

I want to thank my rock star team for everything: Havi Hoffman, Jason Weathersby, Robert Nyman, and Christian Heilmann. I also want to thank Mark Coggins for his strong leadership as my manager. It was a real pleasure to work with you all! Last, but not least, thanks to all Mozillians, and continue the good work: let's keep in touch!

## What's next

I'm now reflecting on what will be next for me, and open to discussing all opportunities. Having ten years as a software developer, and four years as a technical evangelist in my backpack, it will probably be a Principal Technical Evangelist role about a product/service/technology I believe in. Of course, as I wrote, I'm open to discussing any other type of job that would fit me.

I have no issue to travel extensively: I was on the road one-third of last year - speaking in more than twelves countries. I may not have an issue to move depending on the offer, and country. I like to share my passion on stage - [more than 100 talks](http://fred.dev/speaking/ "Frédéric Harper's speaking experience") in the last three years. Also, my book on [personal branding for developers](https://www.apress.com/9781484200025 "Frédéric Harper's book on Personal Branding for developers at Apress") will be published at Apress before the end of the year.

I like technology, but I'm not a developer anymore, and not looking to go back in a developer role. I may also be open to a non-technical role, but it need to target other of my passions like startups. For the last five years, I've been working at home, with no schedule, just end goals to reach. I can't deal with micro-management, so I need some freedom to be effective. No matter what will be next, it need to be an interesting challenge as I have a serial entrepreneur profile: I like to take ideas, and make them a reality.

You can find more about my experience on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper "Frédéric Harper's LinkedIn profile"). If you want to grab a coffee or discuss any opportunities, [send me an email](mailto:fharper@oocz.net "Frédéric Harper's email").

P.S.: I see no values in highlighting the reasons of my departure, but I'm sad to leave, and keep in mind I'm not the only one in my team who resigned. If you have concerns, please send me an email.
