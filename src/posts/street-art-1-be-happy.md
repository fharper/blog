![Click to see full size](images/behappy.jpg)Since a couple of months, I found a passion for street art. Mostly graffitis that are either a vehicle for a message, or just beautiful design. Don't get me wrong, I don't approve the degradation of private property, even if the artist did a good job, but since it's there, why not take some pictures? At least, some of them aren't illegal, and has been made on the will of the owner of the place.

Let's start by a picture I took about four years ago in the Ville-Marie neighbourhood of Montreal. There is nothing impressive there except the message: be happy. Live. Love. Laugh. Smile like its your last time. I totally rely on that as being happy is the foundation of my life for many years now, and I hope it's yours too...
