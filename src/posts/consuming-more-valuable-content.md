![Creative Commons: https://j.mp/KyiqUp](images/listen.jpg) I love books. Actually, it's not true: I like good, and valuable content. It happens that quite often, a book contains excellent stuff, but I have no attachment to the physical element.

I don't read science fiction, but I'm a big fan of books about being more efficient, marketing stuff, having a better life... The way I'm shaping my days, I don't take too much time to read, but it's a shame, as I would like to read more books or ebooks. I read content on the web quite often. I also read some comic books before going to bed as I want to relax, and turn my brain off. So what about those books that I like to read, but don't take too much time to do so? Always trying to maximize my time, I started to read, hum, to listen to audio book using [Audible](https://www.audible.com/ "Audible website"). The idea is simple: someone is reading the book for you, and you just have to listen. Since the format change, and open new possibilities, I can now listen to a book while taking a walk, doing my workout at the gym, or while using the public transit. Just in the last three months, I listened to:

1. [Free: The Future of a Radical Price](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1401322905/ "Amazon link for the book Free: The Future of a Radical Price") by Chris Anderson;
2. [Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1591842336/ "Amazon link for the book Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us") by Seth Godin;
3. [Remote: Office Not Required](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0804137501/ "Amazon link for the book Remote: Office Not Required") by Jason Fried, and David Heinemeier Hansson;
4. [The Icarus Deception: How High Will You Fly?](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1591846072/ "Amazon link for the book The Icarus Deception: How High Will You Fly?") by Seth Godin;
5. [Ctrl Alt Delete: Reboot Your Business. Reboot Your Life. Your Future Depends on It.](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1455523305 "Amazon link for the book Ctrl Alt Delete: Reboot Your Business. Reboot Your Life. Your Future Depends on It.") by Mitch Joel;
6. [Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1591843170/ "Amazon link for the book Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable") by Seth Godin.

Except the fact that you can see that I like [Seth Godin](https://sethgodin.typepad.com/ "Seth Godin's blog"), those six books represent more books consumed than an entire year, where I usually read one to three maximum. This new way of consuming information for me is wonderful, and I think I'll even have to upgrade my Audible account to be able to get more book. Not all the books are there, but since I tend to look for books people suggest me, they seems to be quite popular, and fortunately, has been created as audiobooks too. Are you reading a lot of books? Do you prefer ebooks? Or maybe you already a fan of audio books? Where do you find good content? Any book suggestions?
