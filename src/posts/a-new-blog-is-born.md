Another blog on the Internet, I know. Another blog from me, I know. I wanted to start writing in English, and I love making blog posts, so it's the good way to go for me. Even if the goal of this blog is not to practice my writing skill, I must say that I'm still doing a lot of errors when I write (and speak) even if a big part of my actual role is in English: co-workers, meetings, e-mails, events... It will be a good way for me to practice, and please, don't be shy to correct me, it's one of the ways to learn.

My previous life was only in French: family, friends, jobs, conferences... Everywhere I went, or everyone I talked to most of the time was only speaking French. I read some computer books in English or listen to some music, but it wasn't a big part of my life. Now, my new life goes in both languages. I travel a lot everywhere in Canada and sometimes in the US, so I meet a lot of people that don't speak French. It's gonna be a way for me to stay in touch with these people and as "collateral damages", reach more people. I really love French, but it doesn't mean that I don't love English too.

This blog will be like the one I have in French ([À la base 2](https://alabase2.com "My French blog")): a place with no pretentiousness where I'll write everything that I'll want to share with you. It will be a site where I'll write about day to day thoughts that are related or not to computer. At the end, it will be a country where freedom is the king and myself is... myself!

Like all my projects, I give myself a probation time. Life is too short, so I'm always looking to do only stuffs that I enjoy. It's the same for this blog: it could be a long-term relationship or just a site that will last as long as I'll have fun to write on it! For those of you that know me, you know that I'm always unhappy with the theme I use, so it's currently a work-in-progress. For now, I'm happy with the result...

As for the title of the blog, I think it worth another blog post to explain it. **So, what do you think of this idea? If you think this blog will be worth reading, please subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://feeds.feedburner.com/outofcomfortzonenet "Subscribe to this blog by e-mail") or by [e-mail](https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=outofcomfortzonenet&amp;loc=en_US "Subscribe to this blog by e-mail"). I'm looking forward to hearing from you!**

P.S.: By the way, as this blog is born, it doesn't mean that my [French one](https://alabase2.com/ "My French blog") will die for now.
