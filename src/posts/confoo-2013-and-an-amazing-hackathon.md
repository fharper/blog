This year again, the [Confoo](https://confoo.ca) conferenceÂ will happen in Montreal at the end of February. I will be there, again, with the Make Web Not War team as we found that Confoo is a great place to learn, share, meet, and have fun! For the 2013 edition, we will have something special for the attendees, but we also planned an [amazing hackathon](https://www.webnotwar.ca/make-web-not-war-hackathon-at-confoo/) for everybody, attendees or not! [Sign-up now](https://mwnwconfoohackathon.eventbrite.ca/) as places are limited.

Here is a promotional video of Confoo with some well-known faces of the industry including yours truly.
