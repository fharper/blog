One of [my word for 2015](http://fred.dev/My-3-words-for-2015/ "My 3 words for 2015") is health. As I wrote, it means more than just going to the gym, and eat healthier, but let's be honest, it's a huge part of it. It's something I'm struggling with: I don't like going to the gym, and have no willpower when it comes to food. Those together are bad habits I have for years: no sport and crappy food, too often at restaurants. To succeed, I need to create opportunities. Put gym sessions into my calendar, so I'm sure I'll have time to do some exercises during the week. Find sports I'll like, so I can replace some gym time with something I'll enjoy a lot more. Prepare food in advance, so when I'm starving, and don't want to cook, I can just reheat something I previously done. Watching less tv series as when I'm on the sofa, there is a clear relation in my mind with snacking, usually as you can guess, not the best lunch out there.

You see what I'm doing? I'm creating opportunities that will help me attain my goal. Replace getting back in shape with anything you want to achieve, but struggle to be successful. Find what's wrong, what's preventing you from being a doer. What are those bottlenecks? Try to avoid them and create opportunities where they won't stop you from being who you want to be or what you want to do. Yes, sometimes you'll need willpower to make it happen, but help yourself, and start to create opportunities to help you succeed...
