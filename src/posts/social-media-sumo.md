I found this drawing of [Jeff Taylor](https://twitter.com/moetaylor), and I in my archives: it has been done by an attendee [during my talk](https://fred.dev/social-media-breakfast-montreal-and-the-personal-branding/ "Social Media Breakfast Montreal and the personal branding") at the [Social Media Breakfast](https://www.smbmtl.com/). Nice one, but one thing is wrong: we were not fighting at all. Maybe someday, I'll have [Cynthia Savard-Saucier](https://twitter.com/CynthiaSavard) from [TP1](https://www.tp1.ca) attend one of my talks, and do [something like this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tp1/9683791289/in/set-72157635408286230/).
