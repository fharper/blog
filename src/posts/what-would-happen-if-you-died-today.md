What would happen if the Maya were right? What would happen if you died today? This question is good for all days of your life...

Would you be proud of what you did? Would you be happy to leave the world as the person people know you right now? Would you feel you enjoy your life as much as possible? Those are all valid questions that you should ask yourself. For me, there is more than one way to be dead... I was so bored about all these posts or tweets about the end of the world that was due this morning, that it made me think about these questions. I'm not a preacher or a personal coach, but I like to share about those ideas [around life](https://fred.dev/take-the-time-to-live/ "Take the time to live"), and being happier. You heard this thousands of times: life is short or you only live once. Why not act like if it was true? Be more happy. Do what you like. Stop accepting to have an OK life, and start having an awesome one!

Of course, you can give me all the excuses you want, but at the end, you are lying to you, and only you. I'm a hard believer in the fact that we own our lives, or if you prefer, our destiny. So act like it. Not tomorrow. Not on the 1st of January for your new year resolution. Do it now! Do baby step, but do it now... Tomorrow may be too late!
