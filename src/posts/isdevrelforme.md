When I started my first role as a developer advocate in 2011, it was still an obscure one and not as popular as today. Don't get me wrong, it's amazing: I'm stoked that it's getting more and more popular. Even more important, great people have interest in this unique role. Companies now understand the return on investment. That being said, I often get questions about the role, so I decided to list some of the articles I wrote on the topic. My goal is helping the ones looking to make the jump in developer relations to understand the day to day. I hope it'll help you decide if it's a good fit for you...

Keep two things in mind before reading those:

1. Those articles are based on my vision of developer relations, which differ a lot from one company to another in the industry;
2. Some articles are old, but still relevant. When you read "technical evangelist", it applies to "developer advocate". When I started, the latter didn't exist, and I always considered them as the same.

I may add more articles in the future, and even some external resources to give you some nuance and other points of view.
