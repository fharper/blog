I think I'll start a series of post on stuff I see in my neighborhood, Verdun. For those of you that aren't from Montreal, Verdun is one of the boroughs of the city. From what I know, it used to be one of the poorest, and not so good places to live, but it changed a lot. We are living there for three years now, and this place doesn't stop to evolve, and improve. Of course, there are still restaurants where you don't want to eat, or store you won't buy anything there... We have plenty of little coffee shops, tea places, five stars restaurants... but Verdun still has a strange side, with many, many, weird people too. I wanted to start strong with the picture above.

I'm probably one of the people that doesn't really judge others as I firmly believe that everybody can be who he wants, and live like he wants (always by respecting the law - I'm no anarchist). On the other side, I give myself the permission to find some people weird, and laugh a little. Don't get me wrong, we are all weird for someone else, and I may not give my place: I probably have a never-ending list of people who find me weird! As for this guy, I have no problem with furry, but do or do not: this guy just wore the tail of some animal. Moreover, it was in a Canadian Tire... Yeah, only in Verdun!
