Maybe you would, but as a pastime, not because you have no choice. So work is work, it's not life. You need to have a good work-life balance so you can focus on yourself. What you like. What you want. Prioritize your health, and the people you love. Don't sacrifice anything important in your life for work. Especially if those extra hours are not paid! As much as I wish you the best, you may lose your job tomorrow. Your startup may never be the next unicorn. You may [not live long enough](https://fred.dev/40-life-tips-04/) to finally slow down. It's not being dramatic: it's being realistic. To be clear, I'm speaking about privileged individuals, like me, who can make a living with normal work hours. In other words, your job is only a means to an end...
