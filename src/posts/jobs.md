I'm proud of the [career I have](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper) and what [I achieved](https://fred.dev/www/) in the last couple of years. I acquired a great deal of experience as a software developer and now, as a developer advocate. One thing that may worry potential employers is the fact that I have a short turnover on most of the jobs I had. By respect for the companies, without going into details, here are the simple explanations for each one...

## Developer Relations as a Service Inc

It's my own business. I incoporated to be able to more easily take contracting work when I'm not employed, or [make it easier to employ me in Canada](https://fred.dev/canada/) if the company doesn't have any legal entity here.

## Mindee

ss

## **MeiliSearch**

They fired me, mostly because my personality clashed with someone's ego.

## **DigitalOcean**

I would have been laid off a week after due to a reorganization.

## **npm**

Illegal laid off for union busting: the NLRB (United States National Labor Relations Board) [was involved](https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-238817).

## **Fitbit**

I love challenges, but after months of flipping tables to get resources for my team, I realized developer relations weren't important for the company. They laid off the entire Canadian SDK team right after.

## **Mozilla**

All the developer advocates, including our manager, resigned within a month.

## **Microsoft**

Things changed after two amazing years: green KPIs at all cost and the end of open source love were against my principles.

## **IBI Solutions**

All employees were laid off: the owner continued the business by himself.

## **123Certification**

After 5 years in a psychological abusive environment, I had enough.

Â 

So while I changed or were forced to change jobs way too often for me, I guess it's life... Anyway, I ask nothing more than a place where I can grow within a great culture, a place I can use my expertise and hopefully stay for many years!
