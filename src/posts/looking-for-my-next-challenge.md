Unfortunately, my time at Konstruct came to an end after a round of layoffs, which mean that **I'm now open for a new challenge**. For the last two years and a half, I had a blast building developer relations, and creating or leading multiple initiatives that helped us grow a lot. I want to sincerely thanks [John Dietz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jd-k8s/), and [Jared Edwards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarededwards519/) (feel free to ping them for some feedback on my work at Konstruct/Kubefirst) for giving me that opportunity, and to have done everything they can to keep me on board.

More often than not, when the company isn't going as well as expected, the Developer Relations team is amongst the first to being let go, even if we bring a lot of values to the business with all our activities. Knowing that, and having been at the end of that tunnel more than once, doesn't make it more comforting. Still, it's with a positive vibe that I start this new journey to find my next challenge!

## What I want

- A developer relations role: open to discuss leadership or IC roles (I'm not sure about other roles, but happy to discuss with an open mind).
- Stability: you never know, but I still want a job I can keep for years.
- A real challenge: I don't like easy or boring.
- Certain freedom: I can't deal with micromanagement, let me prove to you what I can do if you let me.
- Trust: you hire me for a reason.
- Diversification of the role: a developer advocate has multiple areas of expertise, not just writing documentation.
- A remote job: I've worked remotely for the last 14 years.

## What I offer

- [Twenty-three years of experience in the industry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper/): 10 of those as a developer.
- Thirteen years in developer advocates' roles at companies like Microsoft, Mozilla, Fitbit, DigitalOcean and npm.
- Tremendous [speaking experience](https://fred.dev/speaking/): 190 talks in 23 countries.
- Experience leading and building developer relations and specific areas like conferences, meetups, documentation, communities, social media, blogs, videos, livestreams, influencers programs...

## Who I am

- Extrovert, passionate, outspoken, colorful, and bold: it's part of the package deal ([the article](https://fred.dev/workingwithme/) I send to new coworkers about working with me).
- Pragmatic, but I have a preference for anything open source.
- More than happy to work with products or technologies I don't know: I actually love being a real customer zero.
- Really good at public speaking, making videos and creating real connections with developers.
- I run the [devrelshow](https://www.youtube.com/@fharper/streams), a livestream where my guests and I discuss about developer relations and all things technical.
- I teach meditation and Buddhist philosophy on my free time.

## What I won't

- Relocate anywhere, but I'm used to extensive traveling, so happy to go to the office as often as needed.
- Be able to work for you unless you have a Canadian entity or use a Professional Employer Organization (it's easy & inexpensive, here's [why/how](https://fred.dev/canada/)).
- Have sales goals: I will definitely help fill the top of the funnel and assist the sales team as much as possible, but developer relations is not a sales or presales role.
- Work for companies that aren't ethical and do not value diversity.
- Work with people who do not like cats (I have two) ðŸ¤£

If you think there is a fit between who I am, my experience and your business needs, hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper/) or by [email](mailto:hi@fred.dev). Talk to you soon!
