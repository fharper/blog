I had the pleasure to do another talk at [Prairie Dev Con West](https://www.prairiedevcon.com/) in Calgary about Responsive Web Design. I need to say that this topic is one of my preferred. I’m really an HTML5 enthusiast and the principle behind this brilliant idea of [Ethan Marcotte](https://unstoppablerobotninja.com/) is just awesome.

As I promised to my lovely attendees, you didn’t have to take notes of the resources, here is the presentation I put on my [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper) account:
