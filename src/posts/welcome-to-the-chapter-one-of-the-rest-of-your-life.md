I feel like we just started 2014, and yet, it's already the first day of 2015. I wish you, your friends and your family a happy new year.

Actually, I wish you more than that... Too often, a new year is synonym of a new beginning: after all, it make sense, you can't have a better anchor in time as a start line. Even if we should not wait to do something new, change our habits or do whatever we promised ourselves to do in this new year, it's still a good time to do so. Think of 2015 as the chapter one of the rest of your life. Forget the past, and start a new life. The life you want. The life you deserve...
