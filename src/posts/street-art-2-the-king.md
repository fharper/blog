No matter what you think, for me, Michael Jackson is still the king of pop. It's why I was happy when I saw this graffiti in Athens. Actually, there are many stores that close their doors with a metal garage kind of door, and most of them have graffiti: since most are design, and not tags, it seems that they have been done by the owner requests. I'll post other soon.
