I'll approach those posts differently, as some people don't get them. I'm not asking people to do my homework. I can easily search on the web for stuff I can do in the cities I'm going, and it's what I do. What I am asking is basically two things:

1. Is there anything, that isn't common for a tourist (like secret unknown spot), that I should do, eat or go?
2. Is there something that tourist usually does that I shouldn't as it sucks, or not as good as I thought?

I'll also write those post after I found what I may do while I'll be there: it will give you an idea on what I have in mind, what I like, but most important, that at least, I did my homework! So for San Francisco (and/or Mountain View), it won't be my first time there, but the last time it was for my interviews at Mozilla, and I didn't have time to really visit   the city. I don't think I'll have the time to do everything as I'll only have two days off, but for now, I have on my list:

- Find at least one geocache - this is a standard item for everywhere I go;
- Find a Starbucks, and buy a local mug - this is a must do while I'm traveling, as Émilie wants a collector mug of each city where I'm traveling;
- Visit Alcatraz - I already bought my ticket, I'm so excited;
- Visit Twitter - Everybody knows that I'm a huge fan of Twitter, and I have a friend who is working there: hope he'll be available for a visit;
- Visit Google - You can like or not Google, the campus seems to be amazing: I just watch the intern movie, so I thought I could try to visit their offices. I'll check with my friends at the Montreal office to see if it's possible.

Since it's not the first time I go in the US, I don't have to worry about buying a sim card. I may not have the time to do everything, but I'll have other opportunities  for sure as one of Mozilla big office is there, and the head office is in Moutain View. Is there any restaurant or coffee shop I should go? Anything else I must visit? Share your experience as a tourist or as a local.
