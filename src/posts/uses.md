Disclaimer : I invested a lot of money in my physical setup. Keep in mind that online conferences and video recording, even if fun, are part of my job. I'm also working remotely for the last ten years. I'm privileged enough to be able to afford the tools I wanted to get a high-quality job done.

Every time I share a picture of my evolving setup, I get a myriad of questions about it. I'm a huge fan of [saving keystrokes](https://fred.dev/keystrokes/), so this article was long overdue.

## Apps + Configurations

The full list of applications I use and my computer configurations are in my [Mac setup script](https://github.com/fharper/macsetup), but here are the ones people always want to know about:

Shell: [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) & [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) prompt

Terminal: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with robbyrussell theme & [seti](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/master/schemes/Seti.itermcolors) as my color scheme.

### IDEs

- [Vim](https://www.vim.org) with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) & following plugins:
    - [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline): status bar
    - [vim-jfmt](https://github.com/bcicen/vim-jfmt): JSON prettier
    - [vim-plist](https://github.com/darfink/vim-plist): plist files editor
