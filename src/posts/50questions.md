Since [I'm looking for my next challenge](http://fred.dev/im-leaving-mozilla-looking-for-a-new-challenge/ "I’m leaving Mozilla, looking for a new challenge"), I'm discussing with many people about possible roles in their company. Most of those jobs are Technical Evangelist one, which makes sense from my background, and from what I like [to do for a living](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper "Frédéric Harper's LinkedIn profile"). I created a list of 50 important questions or information I would like to have when I'm talking with possible employers. The goal is to have answers to all those questions, in no particular order, at the end of the interview process. I wanted to share that list with you as it could be very handy if you are looking for an opportunity in the evangelism world. Keep in mind that some of them are general questions as no matter the type of job you are looking for, you need to know the basic stuff, but there is a big focus on evangelism.

1. Which product(s) or service(s) will I evangelize?
2. If there is many programming languages involve, do I need to focus on one or all of them?
3. What is the enterprise's culture?
4. Is the career path about meritocracy or seniority?
5. What is the team's culture?
6. Is it a junior, senior, principal, lead or manager role?

8. Is it a remote job or do I need to move to a specific location? If so, is there a moving package?
9. If I need to move to a specific location, do I need to go to the office?
10. How the rest of the company sees the work of the evangelist team? Do they understand, and welcome such work?
11. If it's a remote role, how many people on the team are remote versus people working at the office?
12. If it's a remote role, is there any issue if I move elsewhere by myself? Where would I still be able to work for you if I move elsewhere?

17. Would you be able to wait a bit longer after the perfect starting date? If so, how long?
18. Are you expecting an evangelist to work on other tasks while at conferences or to focus on the conference itself (presenting, attending presentations, networking...)?
19. How much travel time compared to other tasks?
20. Are you looking for a developer who will evangelize or an evangelist who has technical skills?

33. How will you attest my progress toward my goals (1:1 meetings, formal reports every week or so...)?
34. What are the politics on travelling (food expense limits, flying economy or premium economy...)?
35. While travelling, is there any issue if I extend my stay if I pay for my travel & expense for those extra days (ex.: time off to visit new cities)?
36. What is the average time an employee stay on the team or how long the actual team is working together?
37. Who are the actual members on the team?
38. What kinds of skills or personality would complete the actual team well?
