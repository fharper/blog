I'm asked quite often for guest blogging on this site, so let me share my thoughts on that so it's clear.

I find guest blogging a really good idea overall. It brings value to the guest bloggers who want to reach a new audience, and to the blog owner who want more, and diversified content. With that said, **I don't accept any guest posts on my blog**, even from close friends, sorry. The reason is simple: this blog isn't about getting more views or even making money; it's simply a vehicle to share my thoughts on different topics.

There are other ways I can help you:

- Share a post written on your own medium with me. If I find it interesting, and I think it can resonate with my audience, I will happily share it within my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fharper) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericharper) networks.
- I may be able to accept guest articles on my employer's blog, depending on the topic, and where I work at the time of reading this.
- If the topic suggested is interesting to me, I could write an article myself about the topic you wanted to guest blog here. It's a very rare case because of time constraints, and it only makes sense for companies wanting to get more outreach and using guest blogging as a growth hack.
