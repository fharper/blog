It was also the first edition of [Go Beyond Pixels](https://www.gobeyondpixels.com/) conference, and I had the pleasure to be there, with my colleague Thomas Lewis.

Levin Mejia, the organizer of this event, asked me to talk about Windows 8, so I created a presentation that would be appealing for Web developers, but also for designers. Here are the slides of my presentation:

I must say that I had a great time, before, during, and after the conference. Levin was able to get industry leaders, but also give an opportunity to the Web people in Newfoundland to get together.

I also had the pleasure to go out for dinner with some of the most amazing Newfoundlander, and Ethan Marcotte:

Levin didn’t talk about a next edition, but with all the positive feedbacks he got, I’m pretty sure that he’s thinking about it, so people from elsewhere in Canada, and US, keep a closer look [to the site](https://www.gobeyondpixels.com/), the travel worth the time, and the money!_
