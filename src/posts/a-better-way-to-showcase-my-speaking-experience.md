One thing I like to do when someone ask me to speak at their event, is to let them know that they can count on an experienced, professional, and authentic speaker. I always had a [speaking page](http://fred.dev/speaking/ "Speaking page on my site") on this blog, but the information wasn't well presented. I decided to do a good cleanup, and finalize the page to give more information to conferences, and user groups organizers, but also to my readers.

Thanks to [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/ "Lea Verou's website"), and his [talks projects on GitHub](https://github.com/LeaVerou/talks "Lea Verou talks project on GitHub"), it will be easier than ever to list all the talks I'll do. I listed all the keynotes, presentations, and panels I did since I started to do public speaker about three years ago: it's interesting to see that [I'll reach one hundred talks in height countries soon](http://fred.dev/speaking "Speaking page on my site")! The new speaking experience section make it easier to find the video recordings, slides, post-mortem blog posts of my talk. It also gives you an idea of the countries where I spoke, the talks I'll do, and more information on those events with a direct link to their sites. You also have access to some testimonial (ahum, bragging) of previous attendees, and access to what I call [my speaker kit](https://fred.dev/images/2011/08/Harper_Frederic-Speaking_Kit.zip "My speaking kit"): a zip file with three different pictures of me, and three versions of my biography in French, and in English (from very small to usual size for conferences).

I still need to play a little more with the CSS on that page as some stuff aren't aligned as I would like to, but still, I'm very happy with this new page. Since speaking is a big part of what I do for a living (technical talks on topics like Firefox OS), but also what I do on my own time for pleasure (non-technical talks on topics like [Personal Branding](https://book.fred.dev/ "Information on my book on Personal Branding")), I wanted my site to showcase my experience, and of course, get more exposure out of it. If you want to check what to expect from me as a speaker, and how you can book me for a talk, [check this post](https://fred.dev/so-you-want-me-to-speak-at-your-event/ "So you want me to speak at your event?"). In the end, it's all about sharing my passion with others!
