I'm turning 40 in March: watch out midlife crisis! It's a pretty huge milestone, so I had the idea to share one tip per day until March 4. A way to celebrate and to share the \*cough\* \*cough\* _wisdom_Â I acquired in the last 39 years. Anyway, without further ado, let's start with the first one...

In other words, stop caring about what other people think of you. Let's be real here, most people don't care about you. I'm not saying this is a mean way, they have their own lives to live. When people do care (positively or not), their opinion of you is really about them. It's based on who they are, and their value system. That's it! As long as you are true to yourself in what you do or say, you are in the best position you can be. The only exception to this rule is with people **you** care deeply about. You should listen carefully about what they have to say, and care about what they think of you. It may help you to grow or rectify something wrong in your life. But even there, it's still a reflection of themselves, so thread carefully.

Oh, trust me, it is not easy! I'm not there yet, but it's going in the right direction.
