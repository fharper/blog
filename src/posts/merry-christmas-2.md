No matter the meaning of Christmas for you, celebrating at that time of the year is for most of us, a time to slow down, relax, and take some time with friends, and family. When it comes to holidays' greetings, I'm probably one of the worst people in the world, so I'll simply wish you a good time with the ones your love, and as the materialist I am, some amazing gifts!
