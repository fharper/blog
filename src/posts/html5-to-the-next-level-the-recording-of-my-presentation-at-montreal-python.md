Last month [I spoke at the monthly Python Montréal meetup](http://fred.dev/html5-to-the-next-level-with-firefox-os-at-python-montreal/ "HTML5 to the next level with Firefox OS at Python Montreal") about, guess what, Firefox OS. I already [uploaded the slides online](http://fred.dev/firefox-os-love-in-the-python-world/ "Firefox OS love in the Python world"), and now the recording of my talk.

Thanks again to the friend [Christian Aubry](https://twitter.com/christianaubry "Christian Aubry Twitter account"), who, like always, did an amazing job with the recording. Thanks also to [Python Montréal](https://montrealpython.org/en/ "Python Montréal") for having me and Google Montréal for sponsoring the event.
