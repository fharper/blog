I just found in my draft folder a post about an online presentation I did one year ago on [WebMatrix](https://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/). Even if the software as evolved in the last year, and that it wasn't one of my priority anymore, I thought it would be nice to share this video as I think WebMatrix is a good lightweight IDE for Web, and PHP developers (note that didn't use it since a year, as I was mainly using [Visual Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng) as my main IDE, and now [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)). It's a also a good way for me to see how I improve my spoken English :)

P.S.: The Demo God was not with me for this one
