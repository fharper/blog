[I want more people to do public speaking](https://fred.dev/public-speaking-at-social-media-breakfast-montreal/ "Public speaking at Social Media Breakfast Montréal"). I want more people to share their passion about technology. I want more people to show the awesomeness of the Open Web, and help others be more open. So when someone asks me if he can take [one of my presentations](https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper), my reaction is: of course!  Of course you can: share it, use it, improve it, change it...

I uploaded all my presentations under a [Creative Commons license Attribution 2.5 Generic](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/) on my [SlideShare account](https://www.slideshare.net/fredericharper). It's easy to download the original format, but if you have any trouble, feel free to let me know. To be even clearer about what you can do with my material, I'll add a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) logo on all my new presentations. Of course, all the content inside of those presentations, like images, are also under Creative Commons license. I as well encourage you to [check on this site](http://fred.dev/tag/presentation/) as there is probably a recording of the presentation related to the slides you want to use: I started to do this a couple of weeks ago, so you won't find it for older presentations. It can be a guide to help you understand the slides, the content, and how I delivered it: in no situation, you have to share the information in the same way! Make it yours.

As I said in my presentation about public speaking: if you are starting to be on the stage, and wants some feedbacks on your presentation, materials, and ways of delivering your own story, please let me know, I'll be more than happy to help. So start now, and share your passion with others...
