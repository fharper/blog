People are always telling me that I'm lucky to be an extravert, that it's nice that speaking in front of people doesn't scare me or that I have the power to do everything I want because of my personality. It's true, but I worked to get that luck...

Many years ago, I was one of the shiest persons ever. I was stressing out just to talk with someone I didn't know, or even someone I known but had authority, as my teachers. I had stomach butterflies, and it was a stressful experience every time I had to do a lecture in high school, or facing something new. No need to say that it was the end of the world when it came to women... With that personality trait, I was losing many opportunities on many aspects of my life. After another missed opportunity, I decided to change. I decided to [go out of my comfort zone](http://fred.dev/the-magic-happens-out-of-your-comfort-zone/ "The magic happens out of your comfort zone"), and speak up. Be that man I was sure I was inside, be more confident of myself, and my capacities. It wasn't an easy journey, but it helped me to go from one side of the equation to the other.

Some will say that I may be too much on the other side as I'm totally an extrovert now, but the story end well: I'm way more happy, and totally empower to take all the new opportunity in front of me. I wouldn't be where I am today without that drastic change in my life, and I regret nothing!
