After the [#npmlayoffs](https://twitter.com/fharper/status/1111694552262459393), I was left with a bitter taste and no job, but it's a good time to be a Developer Advocate my friends. Even more when you live to your values, and stay true to yourself! I'm super excited to announce that I'm joining DigitalOcean (DO) as their new Senior Developer Advocate, with a focus on [the Hatch program](https://www.digitalocean.com/hatch/).

Yes, even if I don't know how to swim (I had severe otitis until 18 years old), I'm not afraid of the water! The fit of this challenge is astonishing: they believe in the importance of developer relations and they understand my role.Â  Our values are quite similar and they were interested in me as a whole (which come with the good, the bad, and the ugly). Also, the people I've talked to were amazing. Oh, and I love the mascot, Sammy, the friendly shark. The cloud was inevitable for me, as most of my discussions were with companies offering some space on their servers. Anyhow, it's not new to me: Microsoft Azure (Windows Azure at that time) was one of my focus when I was a blue badge. As someone who loves to learn and play with many technologies, the cloud is the place to be! We all need it, no matter the scale of our products, the programming languages we use or where we live!

My focus will be on startups and it's a blessing for me. I love the passion and creativity coming out from the young (and older) minds. It's a privilege to be able to help developers being successful, even more at an early stage. It doesn't mean that I won't speak to other audience of developers, but my focus will be on startups related to our offering for them, [Hatch](https://www.digitalocean.com/hatch/).

My first day is the 21st of May, but I wasn't able to wait to share my new journey with you! If you are using DO, I would love for you to share your experience with me, and if you don't, we need to talk!
