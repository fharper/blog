A year is about to finish and another one to start. For most of us, it’s the time of the year where we take new year resolutions. It’s also the time of the year, where people wish you a lot of things like money, love, health… Personally, I’ll wish you only one thing: that 2012 will be a good opportunity for you…

An opportunity to do the things you always wanted to do, but was always afraid of. An opportunity to build the project you dream of for so long. An opportunity to go out of your comfort zone and understand that it wasn’t so terrible… Take this year as an opportunity to do what you really want in life, whenever it’s around your job, your hobbies or anything else. Take the time to live and not just being alive.

On my side, I’ll continue to live with [my manifesto](http://fred.dev/my-life-manifesto/) and with the [Kaizen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) philosophy: continuous improvement. I’ll continue to do what I love, improve some aspects of my life and kill the ones that are harmful. **Finishing on that note, I wish you a Happy New Year. See you in 2012!**
