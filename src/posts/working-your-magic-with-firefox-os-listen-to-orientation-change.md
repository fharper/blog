![FFxOS_Devs_twitterHeader_1252x626_1](images/FFxOS_Devs_twitterHeader_1252x626_1.png)One of the things I tried to do in the Firefox OS application I'm building is to manage the screen orientation. I want my application to know when the user changed the orientation of the phone, so I can take action accordingly. To do this, you need to listen to _onmozorientationchange_, and once it's called, you are able to know which orientation the phone is now: _portrait-primary_, _portrait-secondary_, _landscape-primary_, and _landscape-secondary_.

It's now time for you to add this feature to your application.
