Today I'm in the beautiful Vancouver speaking at the [JavaScript Open Day event](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/ "JavaScript Open Day Vancouver website"). There aren't a lot of talks I give more than once, but this presentation about responsive web design is one I like to do, and which people ask me to give quite often.

Even if Ethan Marcotte [wrote about this technique five years ago](https://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/ "Responsive Web Design article from Ethan Marcotte on A List Apart"), we still need to share the responsive love: our users deserves better experience!

So as promised the slides and the recording of my presentation are now available. Now, it's time for me to go eat at my preferred sushi restaurant of all time, Miku! Happy JavaScript Open Day...
