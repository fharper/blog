![](images/5000120312_a47b4a5034_o-580x400.jpg "5000120312_a47b4a5034_o")_It’s not an error in the challenge number: I told you in the [challenge #5](https://fred.dev/hack-your-life-challenge-5-do/ "Hack your life challenge #5: do"), that I totally missed [the #4](https://fabricecalando.com/and-theneverything-changes/), so I wanted to give my opinion about this one too. I’ll make a blog post about the one from last week, [the #7](https://fabricecalando.com/hack-your-life-project-take-a-break/), later this week._

This challenge is about setting-up a happiness metric. I think that it’s a brilliant idea and without really noticing it, I was already doing it. When you think about it, the #4 is not totally about having the metric, but more about knowing if you are happy, what you can improve and what you need to do to be happier in life. So many people complain about their life: they don’t like their jobs, they are not happy with their husband, they would like to travel more… The problem with these people is that they don’t really take the time to sit down, think about it, see what they can do and, the most important of all, do it. By setting some metrics, it’s one way to do it.

I told you that I was doing this without really knowing it. For a couple of years now, I have tried to improve part of my life. For me, it’s not about changing everything, it’s really about setting a realistic goal and making it happen. My actual step was about having my own condo. For a couple of years now I have given money to others to have a roof over my head. On top of this, I don’t feel like home with an apartment. This step is nearly done since we confirmed the buy of a condo. The last step with this goal will be the notary and moving there in mid-June. After I’ll be set-up in my new condo, I’ll need to make a new goal in my life: something I want to improve. It could be about family, friends, work… anything that could be better in my life. Not that I don’t like my actual life, but I’m one of the kind who think that there is always space for improvement.
