This year I got two book writing offers, but the technology/topic didn't interest me enough to make the deal with the editor: those opportunities make me think that I would like to write a book. Why not? I like to write. I like to share. I would like to develop more about a topic that I'm passionate about, so I've decided that with or without any editor support, I'll write one at some point in my career.

The problem is that since I made that statement to myself, I'm always thinking about it, and the first topic that came to mind wasn't about a technical book... It was about personal branding! It makes total sense, as I like to share my opinions, and experience about this subject. Without going crazy about it, I would like more people to understand that it's important in today's world, so the unavoidable conclusion was to write one about this topic. There are many books about the topic out there, but as all the other authors, I have my own perspective, and vision to share. Since I'm a Technical Evangelist, I thought it was natural for me to take the approach about personal branding for developers.

Let's face it: developers are rock stars today. It's also a question of being a linchpin, doing epic shit, and helping our careers to get to the next level. I won't go too deep into the details for now as I'm still working on the outline, but I'm very excited about it. You can learn more about part of my vision on the topic (not specific to developer) by [watching one the presentation at did on the topic](http://fred.dev/personal-branding-the-recording-of-my-presentation/ "Personal branding, the recording of my presentation"). I also encourage you to let me know if you have any specific elements you would like to see in this kind of book or if you think it's a good idea (or not).

I may end up working with an editor (ping me if it interests you) or releasing it online by myself, but at the end, I want to share about personal branding with my fellow developers, and help them to be  the artist they are.

## 2013-12-20 - Update

I'm now working with an editor who is enthusiastic about the book: nothing is signed yet, but so far so good. Since it's not confirmed yet, let me know if you have an interest too.

## 2014-01-14 - Update

I have good news this morning; the  editor replied to me, and they confirmed their interest. They are very enthusiastic about the book, and I'm extremely excited to share one of my passions with future readers. I'll keep you up to date when the book will be  available, but it won't be before a couple of months (remember, I have a full-time job).
