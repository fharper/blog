This morning I was presenting at FITC Toronto about Firefox OS. my goal to introduce the developers os and see how we can fix mobile web with html5, webapi. As usual, slides are available online.

I also had another goal with this talk. I wanted people to think about the web first the next time they'll think about building something for mobile. If you were not in Toronto or you did not come to my talk (I do not blame you, so many good talks at the same time), you can watch it online.

I'm quite happy with the turn out as I got a full room (120+ people), great feedbacks, and many people excited about the platform. As I said during my presentation, let me know if you have any questions or build anything for Firefox OS. I'm here to help, and wants to know the amazing things you are doing! On that note, have a good conference FITC folks...
