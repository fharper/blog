![Four pictures of Fred speaking at conferences](../images/speaking-fred.jpg)

Public speaking is one of my favourite medium to share my opinions, knowledge and expertise. It's a way for me to connect with people from around the world, and it's also part of my role as a Developer Advocate. Here is an exhaustive list of keynotes, talks and panels I've done and the future one. You can also find resources like recording, slides or articles about some of the presentations. If you want to book me for your meetup or your conference, please check [my speaker kit](https://github.com/fharper/speakerkit).
